instructions: |
  Include a link to the event in your response to make it easier for the user to view it.
  If no email domain is provided for other attendees, call the `get-current-user` tool and prefer attendees from the same domain as the current user.
  Try to call the `search-contacts` tool in parallel when possible.
  Call the `get-current-time` tool if you need to know the current time, e.g. when creating an event within a relative time frame like "today in 1h".
  If no attendees are provided, just create the event, it will be private.
