# Introduction

Welcome, developers! Our docs cover guides, examples, references, and more to help you build extensions and share them with [our community](https://raycast.com/community) and [your team](teams/getting-started.md).

The Raycast Platform consists of two parts:

- **API:** This allows developers to build rich extensions with React, Node.js, and TypeScript. The docs explain how to use the API to build top-notch experiences.
- **Store:** This lets developers share their extensions with all Raycast users. You'll learn how to [publish your extension](basics/publish-an-extension.md).

## Key features

Here are a few points that make our ecosystem special:

- **Powerful and familiar tooling:** Extensions are built with TypeScript, React, and Node. Leverage npm's ecosystem to quickly build what you imagine.
- **No-brainer to build UI:** You concentrate on the logic, we push the pixels. Use our built-in UI components to be consistent with all our extensions.
- **Collaborate with our community:** Build your extension, share it with our community, and get inspired by others.
- **Developer experience front and foremost:** A strongly typed API, hot-reloading, and modern tooling that makes it a blast to work with.
- **Easy to start, flexible to scale:** Start with a simple script, add a static UI or use React to go wild. Anything goes.
