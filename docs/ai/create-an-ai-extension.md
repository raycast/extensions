# Create an AI Extension

To turn your regular extension into an AI-powered one, you need to add a set of tools that allow Raycast AI to interact with your extension.

## Add AI Tools

The simplest way to add a tool to your extensions is to open the Manage Extensions command, search for your extension and perform the Add New Tool action via the Action Panel (or press `âŒ¥` `âŒ˜` `T`).

![Add New Tool](../.gitbook/assets/add-new-tool.webp)

{% hint style="info" %}
Alternatively you can edit the [`package.json` file](../information/manifest.md) manually and add a new entry to the `tools` array.
{% endhint %}

Give the tool a name, a description, and pick a template. The name and description will show up in the UI as well as the Store. The description is passed to AI to help it understand how to use the tool.

## Build Your AI Extension

Just like with regular extensions, you need to build your AI Extension. After you've added a tool, switch to your terminal and navigate to your extension directory. Run `npm install && npm run dev` to start the extension in development mode.

{% hint style="info" %}
`npm run dev` starts the extension in development mode with hot reloading, error reporting and [more](../information/developer-tools/cli.md#development).
{% endhint %}

## Use Your AI Extension

Open Raycast, and you'll notice a new list item saying "Ask ..." at the top of the root search. Press `â†µ` to open it. From there on, you can chat to your AI Extension.

Alternatively, you can open Raycast's AI Chat and start chatting to your AI Extension there. Simply type `@` and start typing the name of your extension.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You built your first AI extension. Now you can start adding more tools to your extension to make it more powerful.
