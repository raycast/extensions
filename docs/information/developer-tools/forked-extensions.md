# Forked Extensions (community tool)

This extension leverages the [Git sparse-checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout) feature to efficiently manage your forked extensions. Our goal is to eliminate the need for cloning the entire repository, which can exceed 20 GB in size, by enabling sparse-checkout. With this extension, you can forgo Ray CLI's commands, allowing you to use Git commands directly and regular [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) for managing your extensions.

## Hint

Please note with this extension you no longer need to use Ray CLI's `pull-contributions` and `publish` commands. Just use Git commands or your favorite Git GUI tool to manage your forked extensions.
