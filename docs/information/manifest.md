# Manifest

The `package.json` manifest file is a superset of npm's `package.json` file. This way, you only need one file to configure your extension. This document covers only the Raycast specific fields. Refer to [npm's documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json) for everything else.

Here is a typical manifest file:

```javascript
{
  "name": "my-extension",
  "title": "My Extension",
  "description": "My extension that can do a lot of things",
  "icon": "icon.png",
  "author": "thomas",
  "license": "MIT",
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "index",
      "title": "Send Love",
      "description": "A command to send love to each other",
      "mode": "view"
    }
  ]
}
```

| name         | A unique name for the extension. This is used in the Store link to your extension, so keep it short and URL compatible.                                                                                                                             |
| title        | The title of the extension that is shown to the user in the Store as well as the preferences. Use this title to describe your extension well that users can find it in the Store.                                                                   |

| contributors | An optional array of Raycast store handles (usernames) of people who have contributed to this extension.                                                                                                                                            |
| keywords     | An optional array of keywords for which the extension can be searched for in Raycast.                                                                                                                                                               |
| commands     | An array of commands exposed by the extension, see [Command Properties](manifest.md#command-properties).                                                                                                                                            |

| external     | Optional array of package or file names that should be excluded from the build. The package will not be bundled, but the import is preserved and will be evaluated at runtime.                                                                      |

## Command properties

All properties for a command.

| Property    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name        | A unique name for the command. The name directly maps to the entry point file for the command. So a command named "index" would map to `index.ts` (or any other supported TypeScript or JavaScript file extension such as `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx)`.                                                                                                                                                   |
| title       | The display name of the command, shown to the user in Raycast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| subtitle    | The optional subtitle of the command in the root search. Usually, this is the service or domain that your command is associated with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| description | The full description of the command shown in the Raycast Store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| icon        | <p>An optional reference to an icon file in the assets folder. Use png format with a size of at least 512 x 512 pixels. To support light and dark theme, add two icons, one with <code>@dark</code> as suffix, e.g. <code>icon.png</code> and <code>icon@dark.png</code>.</p><p></p><p>If no icon is specified, the extension icon will be used.</p>                                               |
| mode        | A value of `view` indicates that the command will show a main view when performed. `no-view` means that the command does not push a view to the main navigation stack in Raycast. The latter is handy for directly opening a URL or other API functionalities that don't require a user interface.                                                                                                 |
| keywords    | An optional array of keywords for which the command can be searched in Raycast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| preferences | Commands can optionally contribute preferences that are shown in Raycast Preferences > Extensions when selecting the command. You can use preferences for configuration values and passwords or personal access tokens, see [Preference Properties](manifest.md#preference-properties). Commands automatically "inherit" extension preferences and can also override entries with the same `name`. |

## Preference properties

All properties for extension or command-specific preferences. Also see the [Preferences API Reference](../api-reference/preferences.md#preference) for more details.
