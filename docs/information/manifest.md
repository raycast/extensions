# Manifest

The `package.json` manifest file is a superset of npm's `package.json` file. This way, you only need one file to configure your extension. This document covers only the Raycast specific fields. Refer to [npm's documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json) for everything else.

Here is a typical manifest file:

```javascript
{
  "name": "my-extension",
  "title": "My Extension",
  "description": "My extension that can do a lot of things",
  "icon": "icon.png",
  "author": "thomas",
  "categories": ["Fun", "Communication"]
  "license": "MIT",
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "index",
      "title": "Send Love",
      "description": "A command to send love to each other",
      "mode": "view"
    }
  ]
}
```

| external     | No       | An Array of package or file names that should be excluded from the build. The package will not be bundled, but the import is preserved and will be evaluated at runtime.                                                                            |

All properties for a command.

| Property    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name        | Yes      | A unique id for the command. The name directly maps to the entry point file for the command. So a command named "index" would map to `index.ts` (or any other supported TypeScript or JavaScript file extension such as `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx)`.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| title       | Yes      | The display name of the command, shown to the user in Raycast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| subtitle    | No       | The optional subtitle of the command in the root search. Usually, this is the service or domain that your command is associated with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| description | Yes      | It helps users understand what the command does. It will be displayed in the Store and in Preferences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| icon        | No       | <p>An optional reference to an icon file in the assets folder. Use png format with a size of at least 512 x 512 pixels. To support light and dark theme, add two icons, one with <code>@dark</code> as suffix, e.g. <code>icon.png</code> and <code>icon@dark.png</code>.</p><p>If no icon is specified, the extension icon will be used.</p>                                                                   |
| mode        | Yes      | A value of `view` indicates that the command will show a main view when performed. `no-view` means that the command does not push a view to the main navigation stack in Raycast. The latter is handy for directly opening a URL or other API functionalities that don't require a user interface. `menu-bar` indicates that this command will return a [Menu Bar Extra](../api-reference/menu-bar-commands.md) |
| interval    | No       | The value specifies that a `no-view` or `menu-bar` command should be launched in the background every X seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h) or days (d). Examples: 90s, 1m, 12h, 1d. The minimum value is 1 minute (1m).                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| keywords    | No       | An optional array of keywords for which the command can be searched in Raycast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| arguments   | No       | An optional array of arguments that are requested from user when command is called, see [Argument properties](manifest.md#argument-properties).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| preferences | No       | Commands can optionally contribute preferences that are shown in Raycast Preferences > Extensions when selecting the command. You can use preferences for configuration values and passwords or personal access tokens, see [Preference properties](manifest.md#preference-properties). Commands automatically "inherit" extension preferences and can also override entries with the same `name`.              |

## Preference properties
