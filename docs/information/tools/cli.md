description: The Raycast CLI allows you to build, develop and lint your extension.
---

# CLI

The CLI is part of the `@raycast/api` package and is automatically installed in your extension directory during setup. To get a list of the available CLI commands, run the following command inside your extension directory:

```bash
 npx ray -h
```

## Build

`npx ray build` creates an optimized production build of your extension for distribution. This command is used by our CI to publish your extension to the store.

You can use `npx ray build -e dist` to validate that your extension builds properly.

## Development

`npx ray develop` starts your extension in development mode. The mode includes the following:

- Extension shows up at the top of the root search for quick access
- Commands get automatically reloaded when you save your changes (you can toggle auto-reloading via Raycast Preferences > Advanced > "Auto-reload on save")
- Error overlays include detailed stack traces for faster debugging
- Log messages are displayed in the terminal
- Status indicator is visible in the navigation title of the command to signal build errors
- Imports the extension to Raycast if it wasn't before

## Lint

`npx ray lint` runs [ESLint](http://eslint.org) for all files in the `src` directory.

## Migrate

`npx ray migrate` [migrates](../../migration/README.md) your extension to the latest version of the `@raycast/api`.

## Publish (For Teams Only)

`npx ray publish` verifies, builds and publishes an extension to an organization store. This command is only availble to users that are part of an organization. Learn more about it [here](../../teams/getting-started.md).
