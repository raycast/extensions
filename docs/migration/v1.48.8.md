# Migrating to v1.48.8

This version introduces a new ESLint configuration file when creating new extensions with the `Create Extension` command. However, extensions prior to v1.48.8 still use the deprecated configuration.

You can use `npx ray migrate` to use the new ESLint configuration and your `.eslintrc.json` file as well as your dependencies should be updated.

If the migration didn't go well or if you defined the ESLint configuration in another place, please follow the steps below.

First, install `@raycast/eslint-config` as part of your dev dependencies:

```sh
npm install @raycast/eslint-config --save-dev
```

The previous default configuration looks like this:

```json
{
  "root": true,
  "env": {
    "es2020": true,
    "node": true
  },
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint"],
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended", "prettier"]
}
```

With `@raycast/eslint-config`, you can replace the whole file with only the following:

```json
{
  "root": true,
  "extends": [
    "@raycast"
  ]
}
```

If you added plugins, turned on/off rules, or anything else modifying the ESLint configuration, it's up to you to merge it with the new configuration.

Finally, you can remove these ESLint dependencies:

```sh
npm uninstall @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-config-prettier
```
