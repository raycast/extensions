# Migrating to v1.59.0

This version changed the `transient` option of `Clipboard` to `concealed`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `transient` option still work, but is now marked as deprecated and may be removed in a future version. You will get helpful hints in your code editor to migrate your extension, and as usual we provide automated [migrations](./README.md) to help with the transition.
{% endhint %}

To migrate your extension manually, you need to ensure that all `Clipboard.copy` that specify `transient` are updated as follows:

## `Clipboard.copy` with `transient` option

```typescript
Clipboard.copy(content, { transient: true });
// becomes
Clipboard.copy(content, { concealed: true });
```

## `Action.CopyToClipboard` with `transient` prop

```typescript
<Action.CopyToClipboard ... transient />
// becomes
<Action.CopyToClipboard ... concealed />
```
