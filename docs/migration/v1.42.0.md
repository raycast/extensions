# Migrating to v1.42.0

This version changed the `enableFiltering` option of `Grid` to `filtering`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `enableFiltering` prop still work, but is now marked as deprecated and may be removed in a future version. You will get helpful hints in your code editor to migrate your extension, and as usual we provide automated [migrations](./README.md) to help with the transition.
{% endhint %}

To migrate your extension manually, you need to ensure that all `Grid` that specify `enableFiltering` are updated as follows:

```typescript
<Grid ... enabledFiltering>...</Grid>
// becomes
<Grid ... filtering>...</Grid>
```
