# Collaborate on Private Extensions

Isn't it more fun to work with your colleagues together on your extension? For this, we recommend to share all your extensions in a single repository, similar to how we organize the [public store](https://raycast.com/store). If you follow the [Getting Started guide](./getting-started.md), we will set up a local repository for you that is optimized for collaboration.

As next steps, create a [new repository](https://github.com/new) and push the existing local repository. Afterwards, your teammates can check out the code and help you improve your extensions and add new ones.
