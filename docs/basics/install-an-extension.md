# Install an Extension

All published extensions are discoverable in the Raycast Store. Use the [web interface](https://raycast.com/store) or the Store command to find what you're looking for.

## In-app Store

The easiest way to discover extensions is the in-app store. Open the Store command in Raycast and search for an extension. Press `⌘` `↵` to install the selected extension or press `↵` to see more details about it.
