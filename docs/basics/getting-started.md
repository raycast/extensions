# Getting Started

### System requirements

Before you can create your first extension, make sure you have the following prerequisites.

* You have Raycast 1.25.0 or higher installed and [activated early access to the Raycast platform](getting-started.md#activate-early-access).
* You have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 16.10 or higher installed. We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node.
* You have [npm](http://npmjs.com) 7.0 or higher installed. If you used nvm to install Node, this is the case.
* You are familiar with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). Don't worry, you don't need to be an expert. If you need some help with the basics, check out TypeScript's [Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) and React's [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) guide.

### Activate early access

In order to use the API as well as discover extensions in the store, you need to activate early access to our platform. For this, open Raycast, insert `0xC0FFEE` in the root search and press `â†µ`.

This unlocks the following commands:

* **Store:** Search and install all published extensions
* **Create Extension:** Create new extensions from templates
* **Import Extension:** Import extensions from source code
* **Manage Extensions**: List and edit your published extensions

Opening any of these commands will prompt you to sign in.
