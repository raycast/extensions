# Getting Started

### System requirements

Before you can create your first extension, make sure you have the following prerequisites.

* You have Raycast 1.26.0 or higher installed.
* You have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 16.10 or higher installed. We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node.
* You have [npm](http://npmjs.com) 7.0 or higher installed. If you used nvm to install Node, this is the case.
* You are familiar with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). Don't worry, you don't need to be an expert. If you need some help with the basics, check out TypeScript's [Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) and React's [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) guide.
