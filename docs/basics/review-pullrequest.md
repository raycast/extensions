2) Navigate to a folder where you want the repository to land
3) Run the below commands

_There are a few things you'll need to find and insert manually in the snippet below_

**FORK_URL**

Open the PR and click on the incomming ref as shown below

**EXTENSION_NAME**

Click the `Files Changed` tab and see which directy files is changed in, in this example it's `notion`

```

FORK_URL="https://github.com/pernielsentikaer/raycast-extensions.git"
EXTENSION_NAME="soundboard"

git clone -n --depth=1 --filter=tree:0 -b ${BRANCH} ${FORK_URL}
cd raycast-extensions
