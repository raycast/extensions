Next, you'll need to follow the on-screen instructions to build the extension.

### Build the extension

Open your terminal, navigate to your extension directory and run `npm install && npm run dev`. Open Raycast and you'll notice your extension at the top of the root search. Press `â†µ` to open it.

### Develop your extension

To make changes to your extension, open the `./src/index.tsx` file in your extension directory, change the `markdown` text and save it. Then, open your command in Raycast again and see your changes. 

{% hint style="info" %}
`npm run dev` starts the extension in development mode with hot reloading, error reporting and [more](../information/cli.md#development).
{% endhint %}

### Use your extension

Now, you can press `âŒƒ` `C` in your terminal to stop `npm run dev`. The extension stays in Raycast and you can find it's commands in the root when searching for the extension name "Hello World" or the command name "Render Markdown".
