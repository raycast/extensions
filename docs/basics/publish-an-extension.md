# Publish an Extension

Before you publish your extension, take a look at [how to prepare your extension](prepare-an-extension-for-store.md) for the Store. Making sure you follow the guidelines is the best way to help your extension pass the review.

### Validate your extension

Open your terminal, navigate to your extension directory and run `npm run build` to verify your extension. The command should complete without any errors.

{% hint style="info" %}
`npm run build` validates your extension for distribution without publishing it to the store. Read more about it [here](../information/cli.md#build).
{% endhint %}

### Publish your extension

To share your extension with others, you need to open a pull request in our [repository](https://github.com/raycast/extensions). For this, [fork our repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), add your extension to your fork, push your changes and open a pull request [via the GitHub web interface](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) into our `main` branch.

### Waiting for review

After you opened a pull request, we'll review your extension and request changes when required. Once accepted, the pull request is merged and your extension will be automatically published to the [Raycast Store](https://raycast.com/store).

{% hint style="info" %}
We're still figuring things out and update our guidelines. If something is unclear, please tell us in [our community](https://raycast.com/community).
{% endhint %}

### Share your extension

Once your extension is published in the Raycast Store, you can share it with our community. Open the Manage Extensions command, search for your extension and press `âŒ˜` `âŒ¥` `.` to copy the link.&#x20;
