# Changelog

## 1.48.0 - 2023-02-22

### ‚ú® New

- **Clipboard**: Added `transient` option to `Clipboard.copy` method.
- **Actions**: Added `type` prop to `Action.PickDate` to control the date components to be picked.

### üíé Improvements

- Improve the time to interaction when launching a command that always renders the same view type.

### üêû Fixes

- Changed `Deactivate Command` action shortcut to `‚åò ‚å• ‚áß D`, so it doesn't clash with `Copy Deeplink`
- Fixed an issue where restarting Raycast would not properly restore menu bar commands that sometimes didn't put anything in the menu bar.
- Locale: Respect the hourCycle, calendar, and numbering system locale.

## 1.47.0 - 2023-02-01

### ‚ú® New

- **Clipboard**: Add a new `Clipboard.read()` method that reads the clipboard content as plain text, file path, or HTML.

### üíé Improvements

- **List Accessories**: Tags can now use any color (we made some improvements to ensure that any color would have enough contrast to be readable)

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed a bug where reloading menu bar commands in development mode would not respect certain manifest property updates (e.g. interval).
- Fixed a bug that caused `Metadata.Link`'s `title` to be cut off unnecessarily when using the large text size.
- Fixed a bug where `clearSearchBar` wouldn‚Äôt clear the search bar when rendering a Grid.
- Fixed a bug where `ray lint` would fail if there were a .DS_Store file in the `src` folder.

## 1.46.0 - 2023-01-18

‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è **Global Fetch Deprecation**: We've removed the experimental support for global fetch in Node 18. The reason is that the feature is not stable yet (hence the warning on it being "experimental" in the dev console) and is not compatible with our new proxy feature in Raycast. We've scanned the public repository for extensions that make use of global fetch and replaced it with the _cross-fetch_ dependency via separate PRs. If we missed an extension, let us know - in most cases, it should be a straightforward replacement.

### ‚ú® New

- **Source maps** for production errors: source maps are now also enabled for production builds of an extension. When an exception occurs, you get cleaner stack traces with proper source locations in the TypeScript sources files (vs. the minified and unusable JavaScript locations). _Note_: An extension must be re-published to enable production source maps.
- **Action.PickDate**: We are introducing a new Action to allow users to set a Date directly from the action panel.

### üíé Improvements

- **Dev Tools**: the "Start Development" command under "Manage Extensions" now starts development in iTerm if installed as the default terminal.
- In order to ensure that date formatting & other internationalization functions work as expected, the NodeJS process is now started with the `LC_ALL` environment variable set to the user's current locale.

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the first exec/spawn call for running a subprocess could be slower than subsequent calls.
- Fixed menu bar icon padding when there's no text.
- Fixed a problem where menu bar commands updated with a new required preference would not display the required preference screen.
- Fixed a rare bug with menu bar commands that could lead to Raycast hanging.
- Fixed an issue where menu bar commands launching view commands would cause stacking in the navigation hierarchy.
- Fixed an issue where fallback images in lists would flicker.
- Dev Tools: Fixed a bug when zip archiving extensions with special characters in file names.

## 1.45.0 - 2022-12-14

### ‚ú® New

- **Fallback commands**: All commands (except menu-bar commands and commands with more than one required argument) can now be used as [fallback commands](https://manual.raycast.com/fallback-commands)! They should all work out of the box (e.g. a command that renders a List will receive `onSearchTextChange` with the fallback text on its first render, etc.) but you can customize the user experience with a new top-level prop `fallbackText`.
- **List Accessories:** `date` and `text` accessories can now be colored.
- **List Accessories:** We've added a new accessory type: `tag`.
- **Metadata:** Label text can now also be colored.
- **Proxy Support**: Extensions using popular networking libraries such as node-fetch/cross-fetch, got, Axios, or our useFetch hook are compatible with proxies if the user has turned on the new proxy preference in Raycast.

### üíé Improvements

- **Background refresh**: when a command misses a required preference, instead of showing the error screen, the user is directed to the preference onboarding screen again.

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed a bug where entered characters could be "swallowed" in controlled form components or the controlled search bar.
- Fixed the `launchContext` not being propagated to menu-bar and background launches when using the `launchCommand` API.
- Fixed a multi-monitor [bug](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/2975) where menu bar extra text would be unreadable on the inactive screen.
- Fixed a bug where menu bar extra icon tinting would change based on Raycast's appearance instead of the system's.
- Fixed some memory leaks when using Form components

## 1.44.0 ‚Äì 2022-11-23

### ‚ú® New

- **Async Submenus and Dropdown**: Dropdowns and ActionPanel Submenus now also support the properties `onSearchTextChange, isLoading, throttle, filtering` ‚Äì¬†same as for List and Grid where you can perform custom logic when the user changes the search text.
- **Application:** You can now get the current frontmost Application of the system with the top-level `getFrontmostApplication` method.
- **File and Directory Preferences**: We've added two new preference types `"directory"` and `"file"`, supported via the manifest. Both types show a file picker component and let the user select directory or file paths.
- **Environment:** You can now get the user's text size via `environment.textSize`.

### üíé Improvements

- **Pop To Root Behavior**: `closeMainWindow` accepts a new parameter `popToRootType` that lets you control when Raycast pops back to root: the default is as-is and respects the user's "Pop to Root Search" preference in Raycast. `PopToRootType.Immediate` closes the window _and_ immediately pops back to root, regardless of the user's setting (so you can get rid of an additional `popToRoot()` call). The new mode `PopToRootType.Suspended` temporarily prevents Raycast from automatically popping back to root; this is useful for situations where a command needs to interact with an external system utility and then return the user back to the launching command.
- **Clipboard:** We added new options to copy and paste HTML content, which is useful for sharing formatted text, e.g. a link to a Notion page in Slack.
- **Markdown**: Markdown in a `Detail` component now supports convenience image references for icons and asset folder files such as:
  `![built-in icon](${Icon.AddPerson})` or `![local-assets-image](example.png)` (absolute URLs and user folder paths via `~` are also supported)
- **OAuth**: The client's `providerIcon` is now optional (extension icon as default) and accepts an `Image.ImageLike` type.
- **List and Detail Metadata**: Now show tooltips when labels get truncated.
- **Action.ToggleQuickLook**: Now also expands paths starting with `~`.

### üêû Fixes

- **Dropdown**: Fixed triggering a dropdown component's `onChange` handler when navigating.
- **Dropdown**: Fixed the missing `placeholder` property in the search bar dropdown.
- **Forms**: Fixed submitting a form with marked text.

## 1.43.0 - 2022-11-09

### ‚ú® New

- **Actions**: You can now specify an action to focus when opening the ActionPanel (and an ActionPanel.Submenu) by setting the `autoFocus` prop.
- **Forms**: Introducing a new Form Item `Form.FilePicker` to select one or multiple files (or directories)

### üíé Improvements

- **DX**: A warning will now be shown in the console when using async entry points for view and menu-bar commands.
- **List/Grid**: Improved the keyword search algorithm to match intersecting keywords (for example, the search term "black cat" matches keywords ["black", "cat"]).
- **Grid**: The grid supports a new property for configuring how sections are ordered. Setting `filtering={{ keepSectionOrder: true }}` ensures that the sections' order is not changed based on items' ranking values; this can be useful for use cases where a small number of fixed sections should always appear in the same order when the user filters the grid. We are deprecating the `enableFiltering` property.

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed the Grid or List's selection sometimes not being preserved when native filtering is disabled.
- The `Image.Mask.RoundedRectangle` mask will be more consistent regardless of the size of the image.
- Fixed an issue where the specified `searchText` property would not always be respected.

## 1.42.0 - 2022-10-26

### ‚ú® New

- The Node runtime has been updated to [Node 18](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v18-release-announce/), the [current](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) Long-term Support (LTS) release.
- Commands can now launch other commands! Using the new `launchCommand` method, you can now trigger a background refresh of another command in the same extension - or even open another command. Some use cases are updating a menu bar command from a view command or, vice versa, launching a companion view command from the menu bar. (Note that for now we only support launches of other commands within the same extension.)

### üíé Improvements

- **Grid** now supports two new aspect ratios: 4/3 and 3/4.
- **Menu Bar** icon tinting is now theme-aware.
- **Background Refresh:** The shortest interval available is now 10s instead of 1m (use cautiously and also see our [best practices guide](https://developers.raycast.com/information/background-refresh#best-practices)).
- **Grid**: The grid supports a new property for configuring how sections are ordered. Setting `filtering={{ keepSectionOrder: true }}` ensures that the section order is not changed based on items' ranking values; this can be useful for use cases where a small number of fix sections should always appear in the same order when the user filters the list. We are deprecating the `enableFiltering` property.

### üêû Fixes

- **List Item Metadata Link and Detail Metadata Link** styling should now be consistent with their respective **List Item Metadata Label** and **Detail Metadata Label** respectively.
- Fixed a bug where `List.Item`'s accessories might not be aligned.
- Fixed a bug where the last API call or log in a no-view command would not run before the command gets unloaded.

## 1.41.0 - 2022-10-12

### New

- **Grid**: the `Grid` component accepts three new props that should give extension authors more flexibility: `columns`, `fit` and `aspectRatio`.

![](.gitbook/assets/grid-styled-sections.png)

- **Grid Sections** don't all have to look the same anymore! The grid `Section` component now _also_ accepts the `columns`, `fit` and `aspectRatio` props. When specified, they will override the value of the parent `Grid` component's prop.
- **List**: The list supports a new property for configuring how sections are ordered. Setting `filtering={{ keepSectionOrder: true }}` ensures that the section order is not changed based on items' ranking values; this can be useful for use cases where a small number of fix sections should always appear in the same order when the user filters the list. We are deprecating the `enableFiltering` property.
- **Menu Bar Extra:** added a new `Section` component, which can be used to better group related `Item`s and/or `Submenu`s. The component has an optional title for the section. At the same time, we are deprecating the `Separator` component.
- **Menu Bar Extra**: The `Item` component now accepts an optional `subtitle` prop.
- **Clipboard:** `Clipboard.copy()` and `Clipboard.paste()` methods now accept file paths as a parameter.

### üíé Improvements

- Improved dark/light mode detection for **Menu Bar Extra** icons.
- If a **Menu Bar Extra**'s `title` spans multiple lines**,** only the first one will be displayed.

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed certain error stack traces causing CPU spikes of the Node process.
- Fixed an issue with **macOS Ventura Beta** where **Menu Bar Extra**s would sometimes become unresponsive.
- Fixed the type of the List and Grid's `onSelectionChange`. It always used to return `null` when no items were selected but the type was `string | undefined`. It is now properly `string | null`. Note that this might trigger some TypeScript error when you upgrade but it should help you fix some bugs.

## 1.40.0 - 2022-09-28

### ‚ú® New

- **Menu Bar Extras** can now be deactivated without disabling the menu bar command! To deactivate a menu bar command, run the `Deactivate Command` action from the command's Action Panel - or drag the menu bar extra out of the menu bar while holding down ‚åò.
- Commands with **Background Refresh** also now have a `Deactivate Command` action!
- **Menu Bar Extras** now support both a primary and secondary action type (right click or control click).
- **Dropdown**'s items can now specify `keywords` to match more search terms.
- **Extension Diagnostics** command can now be used to help finding the cause behind any issues with extensions. It displays all `Loaded Commands`, commands with `Background Refresh` enabled and latest `Events` triggered.

### üíé Improvements

- **Menu Bar Extra** action handlers will now either wait or force a render after finishing execution, to ensure any state updates performed in the action handler have had a chance to render.
- **Menu Bar** commands now automatically refresh when their or their parent extension's preferences change.
- **OAuth**: Path-based redirect URLs are now officially supported.
- **OAuth**: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è API methods for OAuth request creation now throw an error when used from a background command - you can check the launch type of a command to see whether authorization can be performed
- **Types**: Node and React types have been added back as optional API peer dependencies and dev dependencies to the templates, so that VS Code autocompletion works.
- **Templates**: Updated to include the utils package.
- **DevX**: Added warnings when specifying a `value` without `onChange` or when changing a Form item from controlled to uncontrolled.
- **DevX**: For starting development, the CLI does not depend on metadata attributes any more

### üêû Fixes

- **Forms**: The type of the `DatePicker`'s value is now `Date | null` (`null` happens when selecting `No Date`).
  ‚ö†Ô∏è This might cause some TypeScript errors but it will now reflect what is really happening, preventing bugs at runtime.
- Fixed an issue where `List.Item.Detail.Metadata` titles sometimes being cropped despite there being enough room.
- **Menu Bar Extra** `Item` and `Submenu` icons now change based on the system's dark / light mode, not Raycast's.
- **Forms**: Fixed a bug where the initial value for a controlled TextArea could not be deleted.
- **Forms**: Fixed the info icon and message not coming back after clearing an error on form items.
- **Forms**: Fixed updating the placeholder of the TagPicker item.
- **Empty View**: Fix an issue where an Empty View's actions would be rendered even thought the Empty View isn't.
- **OAuth**: Fixed a bug where multiple overlays could stack upon each other when OAuth was initiated from a menu bar or background launched command

## 1.39.2 - 2022-09-01

### ‚ú® New

- **Bundler**: You can now import wasm files and they will bundle in the extension

### üíé Improvements

- **SVG**: Accept a percentage for rect corner radius attributes
- **Actions**: `Action.Trash` is now a Destructive Action (meaning it will show up in red)

### üêû Fixes

- **Metadata**: Fixes an issue where List Metadata would sometimes render Tags in the wrong position

## 1.39.0 - 2022-08-18

### ‚ú® New

- **List.Item.Detail.Metadata**: We've added support for new `Link` and `TagList` item types.
- **Environment**: You can now check the `mode` of the current command _(as defined in the manifest)_ _via_ `environment.commandMode`.

### üíé Improvements

- **CLI**: The ray CLI is now code-signed
- **CLI**: We've updated esbuild to v0.14.52
- **NPM size:** is now 0.5MB instead of 25MB _(binary files for ray CLI have been moved out of the NPM package)_

### üêû Fixes

- **Navigation**: Top-level components can now dynamically return a different view type when used inside a navigation stack
- **Background Refresh**: Fixed an edge case where commands would run into a timeout that prevented further refreshing
- **Menu Bar Commands**: Fixed a bug where the error screen of menu bar commands would repeatedly be shown in the root search
- **Actions:** Triggering actions by _numeric shortcut / double-clicking_ could trigger wrong actions or didn't work entirely
- **Form:** `TextArea` placeholder now won't highlight markdowns if it has `enabledMarkdown`

## 1.38.3 - 2022-08-03

### üíé Improvements

- Added debug actions to all local development commands in root search
- Menu bar commands now show an activation button in preferences

### üêû Fixes

- **Menu Bar Commands**: Fixed issues around hot reloading, unloading, and inconsistent action handler behavior
- **No-view Commands:** Fixed returning top-level props for commands that doesn't have arguments or drafts

## 1.38.1 - 2022-07-21

### ‚ú® New

- üç´ **Menu Bar Commands (Beta)**: For a long time, Commands could only live in the Raycast window. From today, Commands can put glanceable information in the Menu Bar üí™. Check out our [new docs section](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/menu-bar-commands) on how to develop your first native macOS menu bar command with hot reloading üî•.
- üîÑ **Background Refresh (Beta)**: To keep Menu Bar Commands up-to-date, we ported Background Refresh from [Script Commands](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands) to Extensions. Background Refresh is configured with a new interval option in the Extension's [manifest](https://developers.raycast.com/information/manifest) and also works for "no-view" mode commands. Read more about it in a [new docs guide](https://developers.raycast.com/information/background-refresh).
- ü™ù **Utils**: We've released new React hooks to make it faster to build extensions that follow best practices. To do this, we looked at the Extension's repository for use cases and how we can improve them. Most Extensions connect to APIs: they make network requests, show a toast to handle errors, and add caching and optimistic updates to speed up interactions. Utils are available via a [new public npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@raycast/utils).
- ü§¨ **Arguments**: We also ported more functionality from Script Commands. Extensions can now define arguments, which enable simple forms that live in the root search of Raycast. Arguments can be defined via the [manifest](https://developers.raycast.com/information/manifest), and their entered values are passed to the main function of a command.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Subtitle Updates**: We've added a new method `updateCommandMetadata` that allows you to update the subtitle of a command in root search. Combined with Background Refresh, this is another way to present information to the user as dashboard-like items in the root search.

## 1.38.0 - 2022-07-19

### ‚ú® New

- **Redesign**: Along side the app's redesign, we are introducing a whole set of [new icons](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/user-interface/icons-and-images#icon) for you to pick to illustrate the actions in your extensions.
- **New Destructive Action:** You can now specify the `style` of an `Action` to highlight it in the Action Panel as destructive. Use it for actions where an end-user should be cautious with proceeding.

### üíé Improvements

- **DevTools**: Turning on the "Use Node production environment" in the Advanced Preferences will also hide the debug actions. Previously it was only hiding them when there was no Action Panel specified.
- **DevTools**: The "Clear Local Storage" debug action has been renamed to "Clear Local Storage & Cache" and will clear the [Cache](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/cache) along side the [Local Storage](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/storage).
- **Dev Tools**: The "Start Development" action now quotes the extension folder path.
- **Dev Tools**: Added a new development advanced preference to keep the Raycast window always visible during development.
- **Dev Tools**: Added a new build status tooltip to the accessory icon of a development command in root search.
- **Dev Tools**: Improved the error handling for failed extension updates after invalid manifest changes; improved the error messages for general rendering errors.

### üêû Fixes

- `require('os').tmpdir()` will now properly return the path to a temp directory.
- Fixed a rarely occurring crash happening when using some SVGs with a path that contains an arc where the ending point is the same as the starting point.
- Forms: Fixed a bug where stored form values could get cleared after extension updates.
- Forms: Fixed inconsistent behaviour of the `onBlur` handler that could get triggered for the `Form.TextField` when the form screen is popped in a navigation stack.
- List: Fixed the updating of tooltips for list accessory items.

## 1.37.0 - 2022-06-29

### ‚ú® New

- **React 18**: React Suspense, `useSyncExternalStore`, etc.. A whole bunch of new features are available with the newest version of React. See the [migration guide](https://developers.raycast.com/migration/v1.37.0) for more information.
- **Quick Look:** Use the new `<Action.ToggleQuickLook />` action to show additional information with a Quick Look preview.
- **Forms:** Use the new validation feature to check if entered data is correctly formatted and show failure messages with a nice UX
- **Forms:** Drafts support - use the feature if you want Raycast to preserve non-submitted data, to provide the best experience for users
- **DevX:** Check out the new screenshot tool that takes a photo of Raycast from the best possible angle

### üíé Improvements

- **List Accessories**: You can now pass `{date: Date}` as an accessory and it will be rendered nicely by Raycast.
- **Detail View:** Add support for `- [ ] task` and `- [x] task` in markdown views.
- **Action Panel**: Add a new `onOpen` callback on `ActionPanel.Submenu`. It can, for example, be used to lazily fetch the content of the Submenu.
- **Grid**: Add support for `ColorLike` as Grid.Item's content.
- **Forms:** New callbacks `onFocus` and `onBlur` for all the items
- **Forms:** Markdown highlighting for the `Form.TextArea`

### üêû Fixes

- **Misc:** Fixed a crash when using `<List>{response?.website && <List.Item title={response.website} />}</List>` and `website` is an empty string ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue 1845](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/1845)).
- **Dev Tools**: Fixed uninstalling of local development extensions via the Action Panel
- **Markdown**: Fixed rendering of transparent animated gifs in markdown
- **Forms:** Fixed an issue when entering characters with IME ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue 739](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/739)) in controlled text inputs
- **List Accessories:** Fixed the tooltip for grouped accessories; now the tooltip will be shown for the group instead of separately for the items

## 1.36.0 - 2022-06-01

### ‚ú® New

The `<Grid />` component's made its way to our API. It's perfect to layout media-heavy information, such as icons, images or colors. The component allows you to layout differently sized items. We designed [its API](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/user-interface/list) close to the `<List />` component for smooth adoption.

![](.gitbook/assets/grid.png)

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed the controlled mode for `Form.DatePicker`
- Fixed the dynamic appearance of form item's `info` accessory
- Fixed the OAuth logout preference not being shown for single-command extensions
- Fixed a bug where components that are pushed with the same properties values would not be updated ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue 1843](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/1843))
- Fixed a bug where updated list metadata items would cause unnecessary list reloading
- Fixed an issue with tinted, resized icons appearing blurred in some cases (e.g. Alerts)

## 1.35.0 - 2022-05-18

### ‚ú® New

- **List Item Metadata**: we've added a new `metadata` property to the `List.Item.Detail` component, allowing you to add structured metadata. The `metadata` property can be used together with `markdown`, in which case the detail view will be split horizontally, with the markdown being displayed in the top half and the metadata displayed in the bottom half (similar to the `File Search`, `Clipboard History` or `Search Contacts` commands). Alternatively, it can be used by itself, in which case the metadata will take up the entire height of the detail view.
- **Preferences**: We've added two new top-level methods `openExtensionPreferences` and `openCommandPreferences` that allow you to open both extension and command preferences, for example, via an Action ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue 179](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/179))

### üíé Improvements

- Added a new development action to clear the local storage of an extension

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed a bug where the wrong form element onChange handler would be called initially while the form was being updated ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue 1633](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/1633))
- Fixed a bug where form elements would not be re-rendered correctly ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue 1663](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/1663))
- Fixed a bug where a fully controlled form TextField/PasswordField behaves as stateful ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue 1093](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/1093))
- Fixed `EmptyView` not being displayed when it would be reused in a navigation stack

## 1.34.0 - 2022-05-04

### üíé Improvements

- OAuth: TokenSets are now included in the encrypted Raycast export (Raycast Preferences > Advanced > Export)
- OAuth: The convenience method `TokenSet.isExpired()` now includes some buffer time to reduce the risk of performing requests with expired access tokens

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed an issue where updating the search bar accessory would result in the search bar text being selected
- Forms: We've fixed some inconsistencies around form item properties and added new warnings (e.g. when `defaultValue` and `value` are set at the same time); this also fixes [![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue 1104](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/1104)
- Forms: Fixed an issue where updating form items would lead to unwanted scrolling; fixed the `autoFocus` property not scrolling to the focused item
- Fixed an issue with `Action.OpenWith` trying to perform a state update without checking whether it's still mounted ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue 1495](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/1495)).
- Fixed an issue where `adjustContrast` would not be respected for colored TagPicker items.

## 1.33.0 - 2022-04-20

### ‚ú® New

- **OAuth**: we've added a new API that enables you to authorize extensions through OAuth providers such as Google, Twitter, Dropbox or Spotify ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #178](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/178)). The docs contain a [new detailed guide](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/oauth) and we've added some integration examples to the extensions repository. (Note that we currently only support OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, more on that in the [guide](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/oauth).)
- **Form Focus**: use the new imperative form API to programmatically focus form items. Want to make sure a particular input is focused on mount? Form items now accept an `autoFocus` prop! ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #66](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/66))
- **Form Reset**: use the new imperative form API to reset form items' values to their initial values.
- **Form Info:** Use the new `info` prop on form items to show additional information about an item, e.g. to explain what this field is used for.
- The Raycast window opens automatically when you start a development session for an extension. You can turn the behavior off in the Advanced preferences tab.

### üíé Improvements

- Improved detection of default editor when you open extensions from Raycast
- Improved templates for list, form and detail
- Removed `react-devtools` from `devDependencies` for newly created extensions (so that you don't have to download a big dependency that you might not use)

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed an issue where animated gifs would be incorrectly scaled when size attributes are specified in markdown.
- Form Checkbox now returns proper boolean values on submit

## 1.32.0 - 2022-04-06

### ‚ú® New

- **List Tooltips**: List items now support tooltips for the title, subtitle, icon, and each accessory item. For titles, you can use the new type `{ value: string, tooltip: string }`, for icons `{ value: Image.ImageLike, tooltip: string }`, and for accessories you just add the new property `tooltip`.
- **Animated Gifs**: the `Detail` component now renders animated gifs defined in markdown! üé≠

### üíé Improvements

- Improved recovering the Node process after a crash and logging the error to the CLI output
- Added support for running CLI commands through `npx @raycast/api <commandName>`
- Improved the `Create Extension` command to add `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files

### üêû Fixes

- **Detail Metadata**: Fixed toggling (showing/hiding)
- **Detail Metadata**: Fixed only one separator item getting rendered
- **Detail Metadata**: Fixed a crash when using primary or secondary colors for tag items
- **List Accessories**: Fixed rendering when using `undefined` for accessory values
- **List EmptyView**: Fixed an issue where passing a `List.EmptyView` child to a `List.Section` would treat it as a `List.Item`
- **SVG**: Fixed rendering base64 encoded SVG images
- Fixed loading when a new command is launched by hotkey while another command is open

## 1.31.0 - 2022-03-23

### ‚ú® New

- **Detail Metadata**: we've added a new property `metadata` to the `Detail` component; this allows you to add structured metadata that is displayed on the right side in a detail view (similar to the Linear, Asana or Jira extensions). We support types such as labels, coloured tags, links, and separators. ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #219](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/219))
- **List Accessories**: list components can now show multiple accessory items through the new `accessories` property. (Previously you could only configure one `accessoryTitle` and `accesoryIcon`, both of which continue to work but have been marked deprecated.) Each item can be configured as text-only, icon-only, or icon + text. ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #72](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/72))
- **List Empty View**: list components can define a new `EmptyView` that gives you control over the icon, title, description and optional actions to use when there are no items in a list. (Previously we would default to a "No results" view.) You can use the component to show a custom image and text when the search does not return results or the user is required to first perform some setup. ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #447](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/447))

### üíé Improvements

- **Environment**: the current theme (`"dark" | "light"`) configured via Raycast appearance preferences is now globally accessible through `environment.theme`
- **SVG**: You can now specify width and height attributes for images in markdown (`<img>` tag).
- **Dev Tools:** the "Create Extension" command lets you add categories to your extension; the categories are displayed alongside the new metadata on our revamped details page in the store.
- **Dev Tools**: added a new development action to clear the local assets cache, e.g. to render an updated list icon without having to restart Raycast. ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #1095](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/1095))
- **Preferences**: the `required` property in manifest preferences is now optional.

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed the extension icon not being updated during development.
- Fixed an extension's cached icon not being cleared when updated from the store. (Note that other dynamically loaded images in the assets folder may still be cached, so if you want to enforce an update for end users you need to rename them.)
- Fixed an edge case where some search bar characters would be wrongly passed to pushed lists in a navigation stack.

## 1.30.2 - 2022-03-11

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed updating the list `isShowingDetail` property
- Fixed unnecessarily reloading the list detail view on search term changes

## 1.30.0 - 2022-03-09

### ‚ú® New

- We've added the highly requested **search bar dropdown** üéâ ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #72](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/72)): you can now add a dropdown component as an accessory to the search bar; the dropdown shows up in the top-right corner and can be used for filtering lists and toggling list states. (So it's a good time to remove any workarounds with actions or navigation for showing a different set of items in the list.)
- The **search bar text** üîé can now be programmatically updated ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #281](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/281)) while you can still opt into built-in filtering at the same time
- **List-detail views**: list views now support a `detail` property that allows you to display a detail view on the right-hand side of list items ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #83](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/83)) üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è; you can use the feature to display additional content side-by-side as users scroll through the list
- Support for rendering **SVG files** üñºÔ∏è where images are accepted ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #77](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/77)), including in the `Detail` view's markdown
- New method `Clipboard.readText()` to read the last copied text from the system's clipboard üìã
- Added a new prop `type` to `Form.DatePicker` üìÖ to control the date components asked from the user

### üíé Improvements

- **Toast action handlers** üçû can now still be called if the toast outlives a dismissed extension
- Support for multiple actions of type `Action.SubmitForm` in a form's Action Panel

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed some flickering that could happen when using `React.memo`
- Fixed a few edge cases around Action Panels
- Fixed duplicated shortcut shown in the Action Panel's tooltip when setting the default shortcut explicitly on the primary action
- Fixed updating a `Form.Description` component

## 1.29.0 - 2022-02-23

### ‚ú® New

- Add 2 new Actions: `Action.CreateSnippet` and `Action.CreateQuicklink`. Use them in your extensions to provide users an option to integrate deeper with Raycast, for example, by creating a Quicklink from a frequently visited website.

### üíé Improvements

- Various documentation fixes and improvements such as new media for UI components.
- Synchronous React state update calls are now batched, leading to less re-rendering.
- Markdown comments will now be hidden in the `Detail` view

### üêû Fixes

- Fixed a crash that could happen when switching between a development and store version of an extension or restarting the Node connection.
- Fixed an issue with React Developer Tools sometimes not getting opened.
- Limit the width that the `ActionPanel` can take.

## 1.28.0 - 2022-02-09

### üíé Improvements

- Completely **revised (backwards-compatible) API** - new namespaces, better organisation, more consistency, updated templates, revamped docs. Check out the full [migration guide](https://developers.raycast.com/migration/v1.28.0) and get rid of those deprecation warnings. (At the same time, don't worry, your extension is going to work as before, even if you don't take immediate action.)
- We've **prettified the CLI output** üíÖ: all output is now more colourful, cleaner and easier to parse. Update the npm package to v1.28.0 to get the latest CLI for development.
- **Fallback images**: You can now specify local asset files or built-in icons that are displayed when image loading fails, for example when a remote file is missing (![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)[Issue #108](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/108)); [see the docs](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/user-interface/icons-and-images)
- **Toasts** are now passed as argument to their action callback, so you can directly act on them in the handler function (for example, hiding them)
- **Extensions feedback:** We've added **better bug report and feature request actions** both to the store details page of an extension and to the error screen; the actions prefill some data already in the templates so that reporting issues and feature requests becomes easier for end users.

### üêû Bugfixes

- Fixed tag picker images and emojis not being properly displayed (![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)[Issue #493](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/493))

## 1.27.1 - 2022-01-28

### üíé Improvements

- **Preferences:** Added a new app picker preference type - useful if you want to let users customize their apps to use for opening files, folders and URLs [![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #98](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/98)
- **Forms:** Added new `Form.PasswordField` that allows you to show secure text fields ([Issue #319](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/319) and [![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #44](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/44))
- **Forms:** Added new `Form.Description` component that allows you to show a simple label
- Added a new top-level `open` method that gives you more flexibility for opening files, folders, and URLs with default apps or specified apps, often making using an external npm package unnecessary (the built-in open action use our method under the hood)
- **Node:** added security enhancements for the managed Node runtime such as verification of the executable, configuring executable permissions, and removing unnecessary files
- **CLI:** Added more error info output to build errors
- **CLI:** Added a new `‚Äîfix` flag to the `lint` command (applies ESLint and prettier fixes)
- **Create Extension Command:** Updated the templates to include a `fix-lint` script; added prettier to devDependencies

### üêû Bugfixes

- **Forms:** Fixed `onChange` callback behaviour to be consistent across all components
- **Forms:** Fixed generic updates of titles for all components ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #687](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/687))
- **Preferences:** Fixed a bug in dropdown preferences returning the defined default value, even if the default is not part of the list values
- **Preferences:** Fixed the `data` property not being treated as required for the dropdown
- **Preferences:** Fixed defined initial values not being ignored (use default only)
- **List:** Fixed same-rank items with identical names being non-deterministically ordered
- Fixed a bug with open actions causing double opening via the default and specified app
- **CLI:** Removed auto-installation of npm dependencies through the downloaded npm

## 1.27.0 - 2022-01-12

### üíé Improvements

- **Developer Tools:** Added `Open Support Directory` action to local dev extensions
- **Developer Tools**: Removed auto-injecting of globals for enabling React Developer Tools in dev mode
- **Developer Tools**: Added `prettier` checks to CLI `lint` command
- **Documentation:** Updates and fixes

### üêû Bugfixes

- **Forms:** Fixed controlled updates for the `Form.TagPicker`
- **Navigation**: Fixed a bug where a programmatic pop, followed by a manual pop (e.g. ESC) could lead to wrong state (![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)[Issue #571](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/571))

## 1.26.3 - 2021-12-16

### ‚ú® New

- New API for **Alert** views: Alerts are useful for destructive actions or actions that require user confirmation; new methods let you display our beautiful native Alert component\
  ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #48](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/48))
- New API for **interactive Toasts**: you can now add buttons to Toasts, e.g. to give the user options for created items, to open the browser, or for any other relevant context ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #438](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/438))
- New API for retrieving the current **Finder selection**: unlocks a couple of use cases for extensions that perform actions on selected files and folders ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #153](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/153))

### üíé Improvements

- Improved ranking for fuzzy search in lists with sections and keywords
- The icon of the `OpenWithAction` can now be customised
- The env var NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS is now being propagated so that custom certificates can be configured
- Improved the CLI error message when an entry point file from the manifest is missing ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #495](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/495))

### üêû Bugfixes

- Textfields do not auto-transform certain characters such as dashes any more ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #491](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/491) and [![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12&userId=&cache=v2)Issue #360](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/360))

### ‚öôÔ∏è Build Updates

- This CLI of this version contains an update of the build tool with changed (and "more compatible") heuristics around how `default` exports are handled. This means that you should double check whether `import` statements for certain npm packages need to be adjusted.\
  **Example**: `import caniuse from "caniuse-api"` has to be changed to `import * as caniuse from "caniuse-api"` because of the missing `default` export of the built `caniuse` library that has to run in a Node environment.

## 1.25.7 - 2021-11-26

### üíé Improvements

- Keywords added to list items are now matched again by prefixes (exact matches were required previously)
- Extensions are now checked for version compatibility before updating and installation

## 1.25.0 - 2021-10-13

### Hello World

It's happening! We're opening up our API and store for public beta.

![](.gitbook/assets/changelog-hello-world.png)

This is a big milestone for our community. We couldn't have pulled it off without our alpha testers. A massive shoutout to everybody who helped us shape the API. Now let's start building. We can't wait to see what you will come up with.
