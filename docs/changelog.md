# Changelog

## 1.28.0 - 2022-02-09

### üíé Improvements

* Completely **revised (backwards-compatible) API** ‚Äì new namespaces, better organisation, more consistency, updated templates, revamped docs. Check out the full [migration guide](https://developers.raycast.com/migration/v1.28.0) and get rid of those deprecation warnings. (At the same time, don‚Äôt worry, your extension is going to work as before, even if you don‚Äôt take immediate action.)
* We‚Äôve **prettified the CLI output** üíÖ: all output is now more colourful, cleaner and easier to parse. Update the npm package to v1.28.0 to get the latest CLI for development.
* **Fallback images**: You can now specify local asset files or built-in icons that are displayed when image loading fails, for example when a remote file is missing (![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12\&userId=\&cache=v2)[Issue #108](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/108)); [see the docs](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/user-interface/icons-and-images)
* **Toasts** are now passed as argument to their action callback, so you can directly act on them in the handler function (for example, hiding them)
* **Extensions feedback:** We‚Äôve added **better bug report and feature request actions** both to the store details page of an extension and to the error screen; the actions prefill some data already in the templates so that reporting issues and feature requests becomes easier for end users.

### üêû Bugfixes

* Fixed tag picker images and emojis not being properly displayed (‚Äã‚Äã![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12\&userId=\&cache=v2)[Issue #493](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/493))

## 1.27.1 - 2022-01-28

### üíé Improvements

* **Preferences:** Added a new app picker preference type ‚Äì useful if you want to let users customize their apps to use for opening files, folders and URLs [![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #98](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/98)

* **Forms:** Added new `Form.Description` component that allows you to show a simple label
* Added a new top-level `open` method that gives you more flexibility for opening files, folders, and URLs with default apps or specified apps, often making using an external npm package unnecessary (the built-in open action use our method under the hood)
* **Node:** added security enhancements for the managed Node runtime such as verification of the executable, configuring executable permissions, and removing unnecessary files
* **CLI:** Added more error info output to build errors
* **CLI:** Added a new `‚Äîfix` flag to the `lint` command (applies ESLint and prettier fixes)

## 1.26.3 - 2021-12-16

### ‚ú® New

* New API for **Alert** views: Alerts are useful for destructive actions or actions that require user confirmation; new methods let you display our beautiful native Alert component\
  ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #48](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/48))
* New API for **interactive Toasts**: you can now add buttons to Toasts, e.g. to give the user options for created items, to open the browser, or for any other relevant context ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #438](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/438))
* New API for retrieving the current **Finder selection**: unlocks a couple of use cases for extensions that perform actions on selected files and folders ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #153](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/153))

### üíé Improvements

* Improved ranking for fuzzy search in lists with sections and keywords
* The icon of the `OpenWithAction` can now be customised
* The env var NODE\_EXTRA\_CA\_CERTS is now being propagated so that custom certificates can be configured
* Improved the CLI error message when an entry point file from the manifest is missing ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #495](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/495))

### üêû Bugfixes

* Textfields do not auto-transform certain characters such as dashes any more ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #491](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/491) and [![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=12\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #360](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/360))

### ‚öôÔ∏è Build Updates

* This CLI of this version contains an update of the build tool with changed (and "more compatible") heuristics around how `default` exports are handled. This means that you should double check whether `import` statements for certain npm packages need to be adjusted.\
  **Example**: `import caniuse from "caniuse-api"` has to be changed to `import * as caniuse from "caniuse-api"` because of the missing `default` export of the built `caniuse` library that has to run in a Node environment.

## 1.25.0 - 2021-10-13

### Hello World

It's happening! We're opening up our API and store for public beta.

![](.gitbook/assets/changelog-hello-world.png)

This is a big milestone for our community. We couldn't have pulled it off without our alpha testers. A massive shoutout to everybody who helped us shape the API. Now let's start building. We can't wait to see what you will come up with.
