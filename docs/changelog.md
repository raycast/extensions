# Changelog

## 1.26.3 - 2021-12-16

### ‚ú® New

* New API for **Alert** views: Alerts are useful for destructive actions or actions that require user confirmation; new methods let you display our beautiful native Alert component \
  ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=200\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #48](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/48))
* New API for **interactive Toasts**: you can now add buttons to Toasts, e.g. to give the user options for created items, to open the browser, or for any other relevant context ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=200\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #438](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/438))
* New API for retrieving the current **Finder selection**: unlocks a couple of use cases for extensions that perform actions on selected files and folders ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=200\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #153](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/153))

### üíé Improvements

* Improved ranking for fuzzy search in lists with sections and keywords
* The icon of the `OpenWithAction` can now be customised
* The env var NODE\_EXTRA\_CA\_CERTS is now being propagated so that custom certificates can be configured
* Improved the CLI error message when an entry point file from the manifest is missing ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=200\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #495](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/495))

### üêû Bugfixes

* Textfields do not auto-transform certain characters such as dashes any more ([![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=200\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #491](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/491) and [![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimages%2Fexternal\_integrations%2Fgithub-icon.png?width=200\&userId=\&cache=v2)Issue #360](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/360))

### &#x20;‚öôÔ∏è Build Updates

* This CLI of this version contains an update of the build tool with changed (and "more compatible") heuristics around how `default` exports are handled. This means that you should double check whether `import` statements for certain npm packages need to be adjusted. \
  **Example**: `import caniuse from "caniuse-api"` has to be changed to `import * as caniuse from "caniuse-api"` because of the missing `default` export of the built `caniuse` library that has to run in a Node environment.

### Hello World

It's happening! We're opening up our API and store for public beta.

This is a big milestone for our community. We couldn't have pulled it off without our alpha testers. A massive shoutout to everybody who helped us shape the API. Now let's start building. We can't wait to see what you will come up with.
