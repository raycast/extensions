# System Utilities

This set of utilities exposes some of Raycast's native functionality to allow deep integration into the user's setup. For example, you can use the Application APIs to check if a desktop application is installed and then provide an action to deep-link into it.

## API Reference

### getApplications

Returns all applications that can open the file.

#### Signature

```typescript
async function getApplications(path?: PathLike): Promise<Application[]>;
```

#### Example

```typescript
import { getApplications } from "@raycast/api";

export default async function Command() {
  const installedApplications = await getApplications();
  console.log("The following applications are installed on your Mac:");
  console.log(installedApplications.map((a) => a.name).join(", "));
}
```

#### Parameters

<FunctionParametersTableFromJSDoc name="getApplications" />

#### Return

An array of [Application](#application).

### getDefaultApplication

Returns the default application that the file would be opened with.

#### Signature

```typescript
async function getDefaultApplication(path: PathLike): Promise<Application>;
```

#### Example

```typescript
import { getDefaultApplication } from "@raycast/api";

export default async function Command() {
  const defaultApplication = await getDefaultApplication(__filename);
  console.log(`Default application for JavaScript is: ${defaultApplication.name}`);
}
```

#### Parameters

<FunctionParametersTableFromJSDoc name="getDefaultApplication" />

#### Return

A Promise that resolves with the default [Application](#application) that would open the file. If no application was found, the promise will be rejected.

### getFrontmostApplication

Returns the frontmost application.

#### Signature

```typescript
async function getFrontmostApplication(): Promise<Application>;
```

#### Example

```typescript
import { getFrontmostApplication } from "@raycast/api";

export default async function Command() => {
  const defaultApplication = await getFrontmostApplication();
  console.log(`The frontmost application is: ${frontmostApplication.name}`);
};
```

#### Return

A Promise that resolves with the frontmost [Application](#application). If no application was found, the promise will be rejected.

### showInFinder

Shows a file or directory in the Finder.

#### Signature

```typescript
async function showInFinder(path: PathLike): Promise<void>;
```

#### Example

```typescript
import { showInFinder } from "@raycast/api";
import { homedir } from "os";
import { join } from "path";

export default async function Command() {
  await showInFinder(join(homedir(), "Downloads"));
}
```

#### Parameters

<FunctionParametersTableFromJSDoc name="showInFinder" />

#### Return

A Promise that resolves when the item is revealed in the Finder.

### trash

Moves a file or directory to the Trash.

#### Signature

```typescript
async function trash(path: PathLike | PathLike[]): Promise<void>;
```

#### Example

```typescript
import { trash } from "@raycast/api";
import { writeFile } from "fs/promises";
import { homedir } from "os";
import { join } from "path";

export default async function Command() {
  const file = join(homedir(), "Desktop", "yolo.txt");
  await writeFile(file, "I will be deleted soon!");
  await trash(file);
}
```

#### Parameters

<FunctionParametersTableFromJSDoc name="trash" />

#### Return

A Promise that resolves when all files are moved to the trash.

### open

Opens a target with the default application or specified application.

#### Signature

```typescript
async function open(target: string, application?: Application | string): Promise<void>;
```

#### Example

```typescript
import { open } from "@raycast/api";

export default async function Command() {
  await open("https://www.raycast.com", "com.google.Chrome");
}
```

#### Parameters

<FunctionParametersTableFromJSDoc name="open" />

#### Return

A Promise that resolves when the target has been opened.

### launchCommand

Launches another command of the same extension. If the command does not exist, or if it's not enabled, an error will be thrown.
Use this method if your command needs to open another command based on user interaction,
or when an immediate background refresh should be triggered, for example when a command needs to update an associated menu-bar command.

#### Signature

```typescript
async function launchCommand(options: {
  name: string;
  type: LaunchType;
  arguments?: Arguments | null;
  context?: LaunchContext | null;
  fallbackText?: string | null;
}): Promise<void>;
```

#### Example

```typescript
import { launchCommand, LaunchType } from "@raycast/api";

export default async function Command() => {
  await launchCommand({ name: "list", type: LaunchType.UserInitiated, context: { foo: "bar" } });
};
```

#### Parameters

<FunctionParametersTableFromJSDoc name="launchCommand" />

#### Return

A Promise that resolves when the command has been launched. (Note that this does not indicate that the launched command has finished executing.)

## Types

### Application

An object that represents a locally installed application on the system.

It can be used to open files or folders in a specific application. Use [getApplications](#getapplications) or
[getDefaultApplication](#getdefaultapplication) to get applications that can open a specific file or folder.

#### Properties

<InterfaceTableFromJSDoc name="Application" />

### PathLike

```typescript
PathLike: string | Buffer | URL;
```

Supported path types.

### LaunchContext

Represents the passed context object of programmatic command launches.

### LaunchOptions

A parameter object used to decide which command should be launched and what data (arguments, context) it should receive.
