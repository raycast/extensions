# Feedback

Raycast has several ways to provide feedback to the user:

- [Toast](./toast.md) _- when an asynchronous operation is happening or when an error is thrown_
- [HUD](./hud.md) _- to confirm an action worked after closing Raycast_
- [Alert](./alert.md) _- to ask for confirmation before taking an action_
