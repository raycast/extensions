## Welcome to Beta
After months of internal and alpha testing, we are finally opening up Raycast API for public beta. During the beta period we want to further iron out the API and developer experience before we fully incorporate the Store into the app for all Raycast users. Please check out our [documentation](https://developers.raycast.com) on how to participate in beta testing and get started with building extensions.

## Getting Started

Visit [https://developers.raycast.com](https://developers.raycast.com) to get started with our API. If you want to discover and install extensions, check out [our Store](https://raycast.com/store).

## Feedback

Raycast wouldn't be where it is without the feedback from our community, so we would be happy to hear what you think of the API / DevX and how we can improve. Please use GitHub issues for everything API related (bugs, improvements suggestions, developer experience, docs, etc). We have few templates that should help you with navigating it.

## Community

Join our [Slack community](https://raycast.com/community) to share your extension, debug nasty bugs or simply get to know like-minded folks.
