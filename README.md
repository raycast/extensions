# Esse Actions

Use the [Esse](https://esse.ameba.co/) app to perform transformations on text.

When run, this extension reads the text on the clipboard, then presents a list of
Esse's actions for you to choose from. After choosing an action, the transformed text is
written back to the clipboard.

Note that you must install the standalone version from GitHub,
<https://github.com/amebalabs/Esse>, and not the Mac App Store version, as the Mac App
Store version does not include the `EsseCommandLine` executable due to sandboxing.
