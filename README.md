## Configuration

In the Raycast extension settings, you can configure the following options to customize your search experience:

### Default Search Platforms

Roamio allows you to set up to two default platforms for quick access:

- **First Default Platform**: Your primary search platform that will be used by default. This helps you quickly search on your most frequently used platform (e.g., X, Reddit, Medium).
- **Second Default Platform**: An optional secondary platform for simultaneous search. You can set it to "None" if you prefer searching on a single platform.

Setting default platforms eliminates the need to repeatedly select platforms for each search, making your workflow more efficient.

### Random Platform Selection

- **Random Select a Platform**: When enabled, Roamio will randomly choose a platform from the supported list for each search. This feature is perfect for:
  - Discovering content from different perspectives
  - Breaking out of your usual platform bubble
  - Finding diverse opinions and discussions on your topics

### Language Preferences

- **Language**: Choose your preferred language for X (Twitter) search results. This setting helps you:
  - Get more relevant search results in your preferred language on X
  - Find X content from specific regions or communities
  - Improve X search accuracy for non-English keywords

Supported languages include:
- English (US)
- Chinese (Simplified/Traditional)
- French, German, Spanish
- Japanese, Korean
- And many more

These settings can be configured at any time through the Raycast extension preferences.
