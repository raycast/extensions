# SugarDaddyDiabetes

A Raycast extension that helps monitor glucose data from Freestyle Libre 2 & 3 devices through LibreView integration.

## Important Note About Data Timing

Please be aware that the glucose readings shown in this extension may be slightly delayed compared to your actual sensor readings. This delay occurs because:

1. The data comes from LibreView's servers, not directly from your sensor
2. LibreView's API provides data that is typically 5-15 minutes behind real-time readings
3. The sync frequency depends on your sensor's connection to your phone and the phone's connection to LibreView

For the most up-to-date readings, please refer to your Libre sensor directly or the LibreLink app on your phone.
