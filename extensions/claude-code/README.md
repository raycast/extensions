## Claude Code Integration

The extension integrates with Claude Code CLI through multiple command patterns:

- Session resumption: `claude -r "{sessionId}"`
- Context launching: `claude --add-dir "{path}"`
- Project launching with proper path resolution and escaping

## How it Works? / Privacy

How does this extension work? This extension reads local data from your `~/.claude` directory (macOS/Linux). It retrieves your Claude Code (Anthropic) CLI configuration and session data from these locations. When accessing AI sessions or projects, the extension interacts directly with the Claude Code CLI, using your local credentials and configuration‚Äîjust as if you were running commands in your own terminal. If your authentication expires, simply re-authenticate via the Claude Code CLI to restore access.

What data does this extension collect? This extension does not collect or transmit any user data. It only reads from your local Claude Code (Anthropic) configuration and session files, and interacts with the Claude Code CLI in the same way you would manually.
