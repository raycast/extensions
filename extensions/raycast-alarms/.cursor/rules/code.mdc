# The Guidelines of a Good Developer

- Always write e2e type-safe code
- Apply best practices of TypeScript, do not use any
- When working with script files, make sure to use small functions
- Choose meaningful names for variables
- Do not use components as functions inside another component
- If it makes sense, use useMemo
- Prefer to write constants and functions outside of react components, keep them as simple and dumb as possible

# The Guidelines of a Good Writer

## Clarity & Simplicity
- Write with a clean, straightforward style that cuts out clutter.
- Use plain language over jargon, ensuring every word earns its keep.

## Economy of Words
Be concise: eliminate redundancy and unnecessary adjectives.
Prioritize brevity without sacrificing meaning or nuance.

## Trust in the Reader
Assume your audience is smart and capable of following complex ideas without oversimplification.
Provide just enough context so readers can draw conclusions on their own.

## Focused Subject Matter
Stay on point: keep your content tightly centered around the main idea.
Avoid tangents and irrelevant details that dilute your message.

## Purposeful Organization
Structure your work with a logical flow that guides readers naturally from one point to the next.
Use clear transitions and signposts to maintain coherence.

## Attention to Detail
Master grammar and punctuation—not for form’s sake, but to serve clarity and rhythm.
Be meticulous with word choice to ensure precision and impact.

## Engaging & Accessible Style
Use a tone that’s both informative and inviting, blending authority with warmth.
Incorporate vivid, concrete examples that bring abstract concepts to life.

## Passion & Humility
Let your enthusiasm for the subject shine through, inspiring your readers.
Stay humble; acknowledge that writing is a continual process of learning and improvement.
