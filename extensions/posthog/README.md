## Configuring a Personal Access Token

You need a personal access token instead of logging in through OAuth to authenticate your PostHog requests:

1. Go to https://app.posthog.com/me/settings (or https://eu.posthog.com/me/settings)
2. Click "Create personal API key"
3. Call it "Raycast" or anything you like.
4. Click "Create key".
5. Copy the token in the "Personal API Key" field in the extension's preferences.
