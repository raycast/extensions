## Development

### Architecture
The extension now uses a dynamic platform system:
- No hardcoded dropdown values in `package.json`
- Platform data is managed through `src/sites.ts`
- Custom platforms are stored using Raycast's local storage
- Platform settings (enabled/disabled) are persisted separately

### Adding Built-in Platforms
To add new default platforms, edit `src/sites.ts`:

```typescript
export const defaultSites: SocialSite[] = [
  // ... existing platforms
  {
    name: "New Platform",
    value: "newplatform",
    urlTemplate: "https://newplatform.com/{username}"
  }
];
```

### File Structure
- `src/quick-open.tsx` - Main profile search interface
- `src/manage-apps.tsx` - Platform management interface
- `src/custom-platform-form.tsx` - Form for adding/editing custom platforms
- `src/sites.ts` - Default platform definitions and utilities
- `src/yaml-settings.ts` - YAML import/export functionality
- `src/storage.ts` - Local storage utilities
