## Development

### Architecture

The extension now uses a dynamic app system:

- App data is managed through `src/helpers/apps.ts`
- Custom apps are stored using Raycast's local storage
- App settings (show/hide) are persisted separately

### Adding Built-in Apps

To add new default apps, edit `src/utils/default-apps.ts`:

```typescript
export const defaultApps: App[] = [
  // ... existing apps
  {
    name: "New App",
    value: "newapp",
    urlTemplate: "https://newapp.com/{profile}",
    placeholder: "username"
  }
];
```
