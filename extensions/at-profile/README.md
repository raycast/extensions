## Development

### Architecture
The extension now uses a dynamic app system:
- No hardcoded dropdown values in `package.json`
- App data is managed through `src/apps.ts`
- Custom apps are stored using Raycast's local storage
- App settings (enabled/disabled) are persisted separately

### Adding Built-in Apps
To add new default apps, edit `src/apps.ts`:

```typescript
export const defaultApps: App[] = [
  // ... existing apps
  {
    name: "New App",
    value: "newapp",
    urlTemplate: "https://newapp.com/{username}"
  }
];
```

### File Structure
- `src/quick-open.tsx` - Main profile search interface
- `src/manage-apps.tsx` - App management interface
- `src/custom-app-form.tsx` - Form for adding/editing custom apps
- `src/apps.ts` - Default app definitions and utilities
