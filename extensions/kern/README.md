# Kern

Start a focus session and get notified once the time is over.

## Usage

- âŒš Set the session duration in the application settings.
- ðŸ”ˆ Select the sound played once a session is over.

When that is done, start focusing by using the **"Start Focus Session"** command. Use a command argument (by pressing tab) to give your session a name.

## Roadmap

- [x] Show session progress in toast.
- [x] Add notification sound to preferences.
- [x] Stop a session.
- [x] Give a session a name via arguments.
- [] Improve notification messages (something more inspiring).
- [] Use text to speach if session finished.
- [] Try to plause/pause Spotify if a session starts/stops.
