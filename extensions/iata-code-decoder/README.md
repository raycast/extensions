# IATA Code Decoder

This Raycast extension decodes IATA codes for airports, airlines and aircraft, allowing you to work out what a given code refers to. To do this, it uses a bespoke [API](https://github.com/timrogers/iata-code-decoder-api).

So, for example, you might:

- enter "SFO" into the "Decode IATA Airport Code" command and be told that it refers to San Francisco International Airport; or
- type "32N" into the "Decode IATA Aircraft Code" command and be told that you're looking at an Airbus A320neo.
