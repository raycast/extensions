# Progress + Error Reporting Improvements for Parallel Mode

## Summary

This implementation improves progress and error reporting for parallel operations in the iOS Apps extension with the following enhancements:

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. AsyncProgress Counter for Screenshot Downloads

- **Enhanced Progress Tracking**: Added `PlatformProgress` interface to track downloads by platform
- **Real-time Toast Updates**: Toast messages now update every time a promise settles with:
  - Overall progress percentage
  - Platform-specific success counts (e.g., "iPhone: 5/8, iPad: 3/3")
  - Failed operation counts
- **Platform Breakdown**: Shows progress for each platform individually

### 2. Display Platform Name and Success Count

- **Toast Messages**: Now display platform name and success count during downloads
  - Format: `15/20 (75%) | iPhone: 5/8, iPad: 3/3, Mac: 2/2`
- **HUD Messages**: Show platform count and success summary
  - Success: "‚úì Downloaded all 20 screenshots across 3 platforms"
  - Partial: "‚ö† 15/20 screenshots downloaded. Check logs for failed URLs."
  - Failure: "‚úó All screenshot downloads failed. Check logs for retry URLs."

### 3. Log Failed URLs Per Platform for Easy Retry

- **Structured Logging**: Failed downloads are logged by platform for easy identification
- **Retry Information**: Each failed URL is logged with its platform and error message
- **Platform Summary**: Failure summary shows count by platform

### 4. Enhanced Search Apps Progress Tracking

- **Enrichment Progress**: Shows real-time progress when enriching app details from iTunes API
- **Failure Tracking**: Counts and reports failed enrichments separately
- **Completion Status**: Different toast styles based on success/failure ratio

### 5. AsyncProgress Utility Class

Created `src/utils/async-progress.ts` with:
- **Generic Progress Tracking**: Reusable class for any parallel operations
- **Platform-Aware Tracking**: Optional platform-specific progress tracking
- **Toast Management**: Automatic toast updates with throttling
- **Helper Functions**: `processWithProgress()` for easy integration

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `src/utils/screenshot-downloader.ts` - Enhanced with platform-specific progress tracking
- `src/tools/search-apps.ts` - Added progress tracking for app enrichment
- `src/hooks/use-app-search.ts` - Improved search result enrichment progress

### New Files
- `src/utils/async-progress.ts` - AsyncProgress utility class

## üîß Technical Details

### Progress Tracking Features

1. **Platform Progress Interface**:
   ```typescript
   interface PlatformProgress {
     total: number;
     completed: number;
     successful: number;
     failed: number;
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced Toast Updates**:
   - Real-time progress updates as promises settle
   - Platform-specific success/failure counts
   - Throttled updates (100ms minimum) to prevent spam

3. **Structured Error Logging**:
   ```
   [Screenshot Downloader] Failed URLs by platform:
   [Screenshot Downloader] iPhone: 2 failed
   [Screenshot Downloader]   1. https://example.com/screenshot1.jpg
   [Screenshot Downloader]   2. https://example.com/screenshot2.jpg
   ```

### Progress Messages Examples

**During Operation**:
- `15/20 (75%) | iPhone: 5/8, iPad: 3/3 - Latest: iPhone`

**Success Completion**:
- `All 20 screenshots saved | iPhone: 8/8, iPad: 3/3, Mac: 2/2`

**Partial Success**:
- `15/20 saved | iPhone: 5/8, iPad: 3/3, Mac: 2/2`

**All Failed**:
- `All downloads failed`

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can see exactly which platforms are being processed and their success rates
2. **Easier Debugging**: Failed URLs are logged by platform for easy retry
3. **Informed Progress**: Real-time updates show progress for each platform separately
4. **Reusable Infrastructure**: AsyncProgress class can be used for any parallel operations
5. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Final status includes platform breakdown and success metrics

## üß™ Testing

- All existing tests pass (32/32)
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Implementation maintains backward compatibility
- Error handling preserves existing behavior while adding enhanced reporting

## üîÑ Usage

The improvements are automatically active for:
- Screenshot downloads (parallel downloads across platforms)
- App search enrichment (parallel iTunes API calls)
- Any future parallel operations using the AsyncProgress utility

No configuration changes needed - the enhanced progress reporting works out of the box.
