# URL Resolution Enhancement Summary

## Changes Made

Enhanced the URL resolution helper to detect the pattern `.../{w}x{h}{c}.{f}` and replace it with `2000x0w.png` for maximum resolution.

### Files Modified

1. **`src/utils/scraper.ts`**
   - Enhanced `getHighestResolutionUrl()` function (lines 272-309)
   - Added pattern detection using regex: `/\/([0-9]+)x([0-9]+)([a-z]*)\\.([a-z]+)$/i`
   - Updated `isAppStoreScreenshot()` function to handle both `mzstatic.com/image/thumb` and generic `image/thumb` hosts

2. **`src/utils/app-store-scraper.ts`**
   - Enhanced `getHighestResolutionUrl()` function (lines 48-76)
   - Added the same pattern detection logic
   - Fixed ESLint issues with regex escaping

### Pattern Detection

The enhanced functions now detect URLs with patterns like:
- `https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/.../230x0w.webp`
- `https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/.../1000x1000bb.jpg`
- `https://example.com/image/thumb/.../414x736h.png`

And transform them to:
- `https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/.../2000x0w.png`
- `https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/.../2000x0w.png`
- `https://example.com/image/thumb/.../2000x0w.png`

### Host Support

The enhancement now supports both:
- `mzstatic.com/image/thumb` URLs (original requirement)
- `is*-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb` URLs (enhanced requirement)
- Generic `image/thumb` URLs for broader compatibility

### Quality Improvements

- Always converts to PNG format for highest quality
- Uses `2000x0w` resolution for maximum image quality
- Handles various suffix patterns (`bb`, `h`, `w`, or empty)
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing logic

### Testing

All changes have been:
- ✅ TypeScript compiled successfully
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier checks passed
- ✅ Pattern detection verified with test cases
- ✅ Build process completed successfully

The enhancement ensures maximum resolution screenshots are downloaded while maintaining compatibility with existing URL patterns.
