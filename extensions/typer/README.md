# Typer - A Raycast Extension for the Lazy Typers
This is an [extension](https://github.com/raycast/extensions) for [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), which enables Hotkeys to save you from typing things like your email address or any other string you type on a daily basis.

Yes, you could add text shortcuts using MacOS keyboard settings, but you are forced to use text shortcuts rather than hotkeys. If you're already using Raycast, this is a more streamlined approach.
