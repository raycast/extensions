# Auto Quit App

Automatically quit the application after all windows are closed(auto run every 5/10/15/20 minutes).

**Note**

- This extension can only detect whether the application on the current desktop has a window. 
- If the application has a window on another desktop and the current desktop has no window, it will still be quitted.
