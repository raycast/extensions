# Icon Requirements

The extension needs a phone icon file named `phone-icon.png` in the root directory.

## Icon Specifications:
- Size: 512x512px
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Style: Simple phone icon matching macOS design language
- Colors: Use system colors or a simple monochrome design

## Suggested Icon:
You can use the SF Symbol "phone.fill" exported as a PNG, or create a simple phone handset icon.

## To Add Icon:
1. Create or download a phone icon
2. Save it as `phone-icon.png` in the extension root directory
3. The icon will automatically be used by Raycast

Alternatively, you can use Raycast's built-in icons by changing the icon field in package.json to use Icon references like `"icon": "phone"`
