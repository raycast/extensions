You need to create 3-6 screenshots for the Raycast Store.

## Screenshot Requirements
- **Size**: 2000 x 1250 pixels (16:10 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: PNG
- **Background**: Consistent across all screenshots
- **Content**: Show the extension in action, no sensitive data

## Suggested Screenshots

1. **Main List View** - Show the contact list with several contacts
2. **Search in Action** - Show searching for a contact
3. **Permission Screen** - Show the helpful permission request screen
4. **Contact with Multiple Numbers** - Show a contact that has multiple phone numbers
5. **Action Menu** - Show the action menu with Call and Copy options

## How to Take Screenshots

1. Open Raycast
2. Run your extension: `npm run dev`
3. Use macOS screenshot tool (Cmd+Shift+5)
4. Select "Capture Selected Window"
5. Click on Raycast window
6. Resize the screenshots to exactly 2000x1250 pixels

## Save Location
Save all screenshots in a `metadata` folder as:
- `screenshot-01.png`
- `screenshot-02.png`
- `screenshot-03.png`
- etc.

## Tips
- Use demo/test contacts (not real ones)
- Show variety in the contacts (different types of phone numbers)
- Make sure the UI looks clean and professional
- Consider showing both light and dark theme if your extension supports it
