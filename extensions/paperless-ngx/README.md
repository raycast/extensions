# Paperless-ngx extension for Raycast launcher on Mac

A simple extension to :

- Query a self-hosted instance of [Paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) for uploaded documents
  using the API. The only follow-up action currently implemented is to directly open the document page in a browser.
- Display documents in List or Grid mode.
- Upload documents to Paperless-ngx using the API.
