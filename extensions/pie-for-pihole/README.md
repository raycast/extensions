![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22849100/173755322-628ef6ae-bb12-46f6-aa6a-fc789821df85.png)

## Overview

Control and monitor your Pi-hole instance easily through raycast. There are various features baked into this extension,

1. **Query log** - View query log for the last two hours, with client information as well as domain block status.
2. **Top queries** - See top allowed and blocked queries to get a quick sense of how your Pi-hole is performing.
3. **Whitelists and Blacklists** - Quickly whitelist or blacklist any domain from query logs or top queries command.
4. **Pi-Hole summary** - Get a summary of your Pi-hole instance.
5. **Disable/Enable Pi-hole** - Need to access something but Pi-Hole is interfering? quickly disable it using Pie. There are options for disabling for a set durations too!

## Setup

Setting up Pie is very simple (assuming you have a Pi-hole already setup that is). You will need your Pi-Hole instance URL and an API Token.

### Pi-hole URL

Your Pi-hole instance URL is basically your Raspberry Pi IP address. It is the link you use to access your admin dashboard, without the `/admin` route, just the IP address.

### API Token

Find the API token for your Pi-hole from the admin dashboard. Go to settings -> API/Web interface -> Show API token.
