## [Optimisation] - 2023-07-07

This update introduces a few optimisations to the Menu Bar Command. We've reduced the number of API calls, and we've also reduced the number of requests to the Spotify API. This should result in a faster and more responsive experience.

In order to achieve this, the extension now checks the Spotify Application for the current state of the player. This means that we only need to make API calls when the state changes. With this approach, you can still listen and control Spotify from any connected device.

Please note because of this, it's now required to have the Spotify Application running.

## [Version 2] - 2023-06-19

### Spotify Player v2

Spotify Player first launched in October 2021. It was one of our first extensions, and to this day it stands as one of the most popular in the store. Since then, we've learned a lot, received plenty of feedback, and released new, more performant APIs.

So now it's time for a refresher âœ¨

Spotify Player v2 is a complete re-write, focusing on performance, maintainability, and user experience. One of our main goals was to keep the list of commands to a minimum but still allow users to tailor their own experience. This way, both new users of Raycast, as well as more advanced ones, can make the most of Spotify Player.

#### New Features

- Updated Extension icon
- Updated Menu Bar icon
- Support Podcasts and Episodes in "Now Playing"/"Menu Bar Player"
- Support Podcasts and Episodes in "Search"/"Your Library"
- Support "Transfer Playback" action, available in "Now Playing"/"Menu Bar Player"
- Support "Add to Playlist" action, available in "Now Playing"/"Menu Bar Player"

#### New Commands

- **Search:** A single unified search command. Use this to search for artists, albums, songs, playlists, podcasts, and episodes. Use the dropdown menu to filter your search to a specific category. Each category offers contextual actions, so you can dive deeper into the search.
- **Your Library:** Use this to see your saved artists, albums, songs, playlists, and podcasts. Similar to the "Search" command, it includes a category dropdown and contextual actions.
- **Quick Actions:** This is a list of lots of Spotify actions. For example: Play/Pause, Like/Dislike current song, Change Volume, and more. If you'd like to have any of these available as a Root Command, you can create Quicklinks via the actions menu (âŒ˜ K).
- **Toggle Play/Pause:** Use this to toggle the playback of the current song.
- **Next:** Use this to skip to the next song/episode.
- **Previous:** Use this to skip to the previous song/episode.

#### Disabled Commands

This extension includes a few commands that are disabled by default. You can enable them by going to the extension's settings. These commands are:

- **Like:**
  Use this to like the current song.

#### General improvements

- Menu Bar Player Preferences: "showEllipsis" setting has been removed. It'll always show ellipsis if the title needs to be truncated (based on the "Max Text Length" setting)

We hope you enjoy the new and improved Spotify Player Extension â€” we've [obsessed over every detail](https://twitter.com/peduarte/status/1638101325312577536).
