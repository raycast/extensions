# Generate Apple-Like Password

Generates a pronouncable, easy to remember yet still secure password in the style of Apple Keychain

I did not make this algorithm! I found it in Apple Shortcut form in [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/caz8kd/generate_apple_keychain_style_password/). 
Unfortunately, the account behind the post has been deleted, so I could not ask for permission to use, however I (and I'm sure I'm not the only one) really appreciate this being nicer implemented within Raycast.
