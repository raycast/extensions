# How to use

This package requires a valid `Session Token` from ChatGPT to access it's unofficial REST API by [transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api).

To get a session token:

1. Go to https://chat.openai.com/chat and log in or sign up.
2. Open dev tools.
3. Open `Application` > `Cookies`.

   ![ChatGPT cookies](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api/blob/main/media/session-token.png?raw=true)

4. Copy the value of `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` and paste it in the `Session Token` initialization set-up field!

### Update December 11, 2022

> An update note from [the API author](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api)

Today, OpenAI added additional Cloudflare protections that make it more difficult to access the unofficial API. Here's some additional steps that you need to follow:

5. Copy the value of the `cf_clearance` cookie and paste it in the `Clearance Token` initialization set-up field.

6. Copy your browser's `user-agent` header from any request in your browser's network tab and paste it in the `User Agent` initialization set-up field.

Restrictions on this method:

- Cloudflare `cf_clearance` **tokens expire after 2 hours**, so there will be a pop-up reminder to update your token if you had an invalid token value.
- Your `user-agent` and `IP address` **must match** from the real browser window you're logged in with to the one you're using for the extension.
  - This means that you currently can't log in with your laptop and then run the extension in the same time.
- You should not be using this account while the extension is already running, because that browser window may refresh one of your tokens and invalidate the extension's session.
