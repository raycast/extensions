## [Fix] - 2024-10-09

- Chore: Removed `List.EmptyView` when the model list is empty, as the Action panel would remain empty and default models ensure the model list is not empty.

## [Feature] - 2024-10-06

- Feature: Change all occurence of `gpt-3.5` and the like to `gpt-4o-mini`, as the latter is cheaper and more efficient.
- Feature: Update `setOption` to include all model IDs, removing the filter for 'gpt' prefix. (To support `o1` models).
- Chore: Remove unnecessary union type literals in `src/type.ts:Model.option`, since 'option' was already effectively a 'string'.
