# DevDocs Extension

Browse any [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/) documenation from raycast.

## Commands

### Search Documentations

With a selected documentation, you may use the "Save as Quicklink" action to scope future entries search to just this documentation.

### Search Entries

Pass the documentation slug as an argument. For example, use "javascript" or "python~3.12" depending on whether the desired documentation specifies a version.

The `Open in DevDocs` action requires the [DevDocs app](https://github.com/dteoh/devdocs-macos) to be installed.
