# DevDocs Extension

Browse [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/) documenation from Raycast.

## Commands

### Search Documentations

With a selected documentation, you may use the "Save as Quicklink" action to scope future entries search to just this documentation.

### Search Entries

Pass the documentation slug as an argument. For example, use "javascript" or "python~3.12" depending on whether the desired documentation specifies a version.

The `Open in DevDocs` action requires the [DevDocs app](https://github.com/dteoh/devdocs-macos) to be installed.

## Preferences

### Primary entries action

When viewing a list of documentation entries, the primary action can be configured to open either the entry in your browser (default) or in the DevDocs macOS app. Whichever item is not set by this preference will be available as the secondary action.
