You can also configure additional parameters like disabling input/output capture using `capture_input=False` and `capture_output=False` [(1)](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/decorators#decorator-arguments).\n\nFor short-lived environments like AWS Lambda, make sure to call `flush()` before the function terminates to avoid losing events [(1)](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/decorators#decorator-arguments).\n\nThe decorator integrates seamlessly with OpenAI, LangChain, and LlamaIndex frameworks [(1)](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/decorators#decorator-arguments)."
