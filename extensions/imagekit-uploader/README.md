# ImageKit Uploader

Upload Image to [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io/)

1. upload the selected image in the `Finder` app
2. upload the image in your clipboard
3. view the uploads history

## Setup

We need to get configured before start!

We need these preferences `publicKey`, `privateKey` and `URL-endpoint` which are required by `ImageKit`.

You can find these in your `ImageKit` [developer options page](https://imagekit.io/dashboard/developer/api-keys)
