- **Daily**: Run commands at the same time every day
- **Weekly**: Schedule commands for specific days of the week
- **Monthly**: Execute commands on a particular day of each month
- **Custom Cron**: Use cron expressions for complex, highly specific schedules

## Schedule Management

- **View & Filter**: See all your scheduled commands with filtering by schedule type
- **Enable/Disable**: Easily toggle commands on or off without deleting them
- **Edit Schedules**: Modify existing scheduled commands anytime
- **Execution Logs**: Track when commands run and view any errors

## Creating a Scheduled Command

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Executing?

1. Check if the command is enabled in your scheduled commands list
2. Verify the deeplink is correct by testing it manually in Raycast
3. Review execution logs for error messages

### Permission Issues?

Some commands may require permissions that need to be granted when they first run. Check the execution logs for permission-related errors.

### Viewing Logs

Use "View Execution Logs" to see:

- When commands were executed
- Success/failure status
- Error messages for failed executions
- Command execution history
