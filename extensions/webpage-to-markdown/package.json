[Many of you](https://x.com/peduarte/status/1800126943364534731) are actively sharing and recommending Raycast on your social platforms, videos, and podcasts. And that means a lot to us.\n\nLast year, we introduced the [Raycast Referral Program](https://www.raycast.com/changelog/1-62-0), available through the `Share Raycast` command. This command gives Pro users a limited number of promo codes. When someone signs up through a promo code, they get a free month of Raycast Pro, and so does the referrer.\n\nThat was a good starting point, but you deserve more. So today, we‚Äôre introducing the Raycast Affiliate Program.\n\nAs an affiliate, you can **earn a 30% commission** on all payments coming from users you brought to Raycast Pro. In return, your referrals will get a 10% discount.\n\nYou can become an affiliate by visiting the [Affiliate Program](https://www.raycast.com/settings/affiliate) page in your settings, or via the `Become an Affiliate` command (if you don't see it, run `Check for Updates` in Raycast).\n\n### [Can anyone join?](https://www.raycast.com/blog/affiliate-program#can-anyone-join)\n\nUnlike the Referral Program, which is limited to Pro users, anyone with a Raycast account can apply to become an affiliate.\n\n### [Which affiliate management system are you using?](https://www.raycast.com/blog/affiliate-program#which-affiliate-management-system-are-you-using)\n\nWe‚Äôre using [Rewardful](https://getrewardful.com/), as it integrates with Stripe. We also looked at [FirstPromoter](https://firstpromoter.com/), which seems to be equally as good.\n\n### [Where is my affiliate URL?](https://www.raycast.com/blog/affiliate-program#where-is-my-affiliate-url)\n\nYou can get your affiliate URL from your [Rewardful Dashboard](https://affiliates.raycast.com/login). It looks like this `https://raycast.com?via=rewardful_username`.\n\nTip: Create a redirect from your domain, so it's more personally branded, eg: `ped.ro/raycast`.\n\n### [How do I get paid?](https://www.raycast.com/blog/affiliate-program#how-do-i-get-paid)\n\nCommissions are paid out via¬†[Wise](https://wise.com/)¬†once they exceed the threshold of ¬£50, and will be pending for 30 days before they‚Äôre considered payable. This is to account for any cancellations or refunds.\n\n### [What if I don‚Äôt have Wise?](https://www.raycast.com/blog/affiliate-program#what-if-i-dont-have-wise)\n\nIf you don‚Äôt have a Wise account and are unable to create one (due to country restrictions) you‚Äôll be unable to receive payment. Unfortunately at this stage we can‚Äôt handle multiple payment providers, and we have decided to use Wise over PayPal.\n\n### [Are there any affiliate resources?](https://www.raycast.com/blog/affiliate-program#are-there-any-affiliate-resources)\n\nNot yet, but we‚Äôll get on that soon.\n\n### [Can I refer myself?](https://www.raycast.com/blog/affiliate-program#can-i-refer-myself)\n\nNo, please don‚Äôt do that. Rewardul will automatically identify self-referrals and notify us for review. Self-referrals will result in the referral and the Pro subscription being deactivated.\n\n### [Any questions?](https://www.raycast.com/blog/affiliate-program#any-questions)\n\nIf you have any more questions, reach out to us on [Twitter/ùïè](https://ray.so/x) or shoot us an email at `affiliates@raycast.com`."
