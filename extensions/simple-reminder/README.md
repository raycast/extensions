## Limitations

When you install the extension, notifications will by default be non-sticky. Which means that they will display on your system, and after a second or two, they will go away from the screen and only stay in the notification center.

To change the behaviour so that the system notification will remain in the screen until you dismiss it, you will need to do two things:

> 1. Open the system preferences and go to "Notifications & Focus"
> 2. Go to the "Script Editor" and change the notification type from "Banners" to "Alerts"
