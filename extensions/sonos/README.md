# Sonos

This extension will automatically try to detect your Sonos system. Make sure this computer is connected to the same local network
as the system you are intending to control.

If you have more than one group available in your system you need to explicitly pick which one to control. Use the `Set Active Group` command first, and then all the other actions will use that choice.
