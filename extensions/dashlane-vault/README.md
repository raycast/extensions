The extension relies on the Dashlane CLI, so every security consideration that applies to the CLI applies to the extension as well. See <https://dashlane.github.io/dashlane-cli> for more information.

### Caching

Out of the box, the extension caches the **non-sensitive** part of your vault to ensure faster access. Secrets like passwords, identity fields secret notes and others sensitive data are **never** saved.
