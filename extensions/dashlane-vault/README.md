## Setup

Before you're able to use this extension, you need to following these steps:

### Step 1 - Install the Dashlane CLI

Follow the install steps from the official [Dashlane CLI documentation](https://dashlane.github.io/dashlane-cli/install).

```sh
brew install dashlane/tap/dashlane-cli
```

### Step 2 - Login to your Dashlane account

Follow the authentication steps from the official [Dashlane CLI documentation](https://dashlane.github.io/dashlane-cli/personal/authentication).

### You're all set! üéâ

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with syncing your vault or if passwords and notes are not appearing, please follow these steps:

1. Check if the Dashlane CLI is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
dcli --version
```

2. Verify if you are logged in by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
dcli accounts whoami
```

3. Retrieve the path to the Dashlane CLI by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
which dcli
```

4. Set the path to the Dashlane CLI in the extension preferences of Raycast. Open Raycast preferences, navigate to the Dashlane Vault extension, and specify the path to the Dashlane CLI.

## Security

The extension relies on the Dashlane CLI, so every security consideration that applies to the CLI applies to the extension as well. See <https://dashlane.github.io/dashlane-cli> for more information.

### Caching

Out of the box, the extension caches the **non-sensitive** part of your vault to ensure faster access. Secrets like passwords, identity fields secret notes and others sensitive data are **never** saved.

### Limitations

The Dashlane CLI supports an [option](https://dashlane.github.io/dashlane-cli/personal/authentication#options) `save-master-password` to request the user's master password. This option is not supported by the extension yet, so you'll need to keep the default which is `true`.
