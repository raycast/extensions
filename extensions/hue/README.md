# Hue

Quickly and easily control Philips Hue lights

## Setup

Before using the extension, you need to link with your Philips Hue bridge.

### Automatic setup

Please follow the instructions shown when using any of the commands except the “Toggle All Lights” command.

### Manual setup

1. Find the IP address of your Hue Bridge
2. Go to the extension’s settings and enter the IP address

## Icons

The icons used in the “Control Lights” command are from
the [Philips Hue Icon Pack](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/application-design-guidance/icon-pack/).

## Known issues

There is a known issue where some older model bridges using self-signed certificates fail to connect. As the
developer of this extension does not have access to such a bridge, and no one with access to such a bridge has offered
help, this unfortunately means that no solution has been found yet.
