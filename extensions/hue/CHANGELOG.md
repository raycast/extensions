# Hue Changelog

## [Hue Extension 2.0] - 2023-04-17

* Show groups and scenes as gradients
* Show lights as tinted icons
* Use rate limiting to improve behaviour when holding down a hotkey and to prevent rate limiting errors
* Update the UI when lights are changed by e.g. the Hue app or a physical switch
* Many improvements under the hood to improve performance, responsiveness and reliability
  * Use Hue API V2: ‘Connected Lighting Interface Protocol’ or CLIP
  * Connect with the Hue Bridge using TLS (HTTPS) and HTTP/2
  * Use a single persistent connection to send and receive data to and from Hue bridge
* Deprecation: It is no longer possible to set/adjust the color (temperature) of a group since this is not supported by
  the Hue API V2. It may be added in the future with a workaround. Please use scenes or individual lights instead.

You will need to re-link your Hue Bridge to use the new version.
