## Why This Extension Exists

I'm dyslexic (shoutout to fellow dyslexics! üëã), and I just wanted something that could read any text to me. Whether I'm browsing the web, in Slack, poking around Cursor agent chats, or anywhere else on my Mac.

The built-in Mac and Chrome voices are still stuck in the uncanny valley, and Chrome extensions like Speechy require a subscription to be truly useful. So I built this with goal of pay-as-you-go high-quality text-to-speech for *any* selected text, anywhere on your system, powered by OpenAI's latest voices‚Äîright from Raycast. Enjoy!
