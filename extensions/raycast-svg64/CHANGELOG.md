# svg64 - Convert SVGs to base64 Strings Changelog

## [Initial Version] - 2023-08-18

Added two commands:

- Copy the Encoded Base64 from a SVG file
- Copy the Encoded Base64 from SVG text

You can choose the format you copy the text in in both commands... either in Raw format, Markdown image format, or CSS URL format. This settings saves when you submit the form, and is synced between both commands.
