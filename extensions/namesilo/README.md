# NameSilo

This is a Raycast extension for [NameSilo](https://www.namesilo.com/). With this extension, you can fetch latest domain pricing and view Domains, Orders, Account Balance. You can also run a Whois Check for a domain.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install extension**: Click the `Install Extension` button in the top right of [this page](https://www.raycast.com/xmok/namesilo) OR via Raycast Store

2. **Get your API Key**: The first time you use the extension, you'll need to enter your 'NameSilo' API Key:

    a. `Sign in to your Account` at [this link](https://www.namesilo.com/login)

    (if you don't have an account, `Sign up` at [this link](https://www.namesilo.com/sign-up))

    b. `Navigate` to `API Manager`

    c. `Generate` an API Key
    
    (OPTIONAL: `check` "Generate key for read-only access")

    d. `Copy` the "API Key"

    c. `Enter this key` in Preferences OR at first prompt

## üóíÔ∏è NOTES

- Using `namesilo.com` as a query/parameter will almost always show an error e.g. running a `whois` for "namesilo.com" will error out. This is an issue with the API.
- You can email the NameSilo team to get access to a Sandbox / OTE environment but the extension does not currently support OTE (this might change in the future).
