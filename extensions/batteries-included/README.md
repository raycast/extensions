# Batteries Included

A simple raycast application to showcase the battery levels of your connected devices (laptop, mouse, keyboard, etc).

Mostly a proof of concept, and a way to learn how to use the Raycast API.

Parts of the code are forks of the [Toothpick](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/toothpick) and [Battery status](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/battery-menubar) extensions.
