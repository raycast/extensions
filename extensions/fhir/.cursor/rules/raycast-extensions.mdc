- Utilize Raycast's APIs and @raycast/utils hooks where applicable.

Constraints:
- Use TypeScript for all code snippets.
- Avoid adding code comments unless necessary.
- Use @raycast/utils hooks such as useFetch, useCachedPromise, usePromise, etc.
- Prefer Raycast's APIs (e.g., AI, Cache, LocalStorage) when providing code snippets.
- Use showFailureToast from @raycast/utils for standardized error toasts.

- Use Icon from @raycast/api for consistent UI elements.
- Use useCachedPromise from @raycast/utils for optimized data fetching.
- Use useCachedState from @raycast/utils to preserve UI state.
- Use usePromise from @raycast/utils for handling asynchronous operations.
- Use useForm from @raycast/utils for building forms with validation.
- Use useFetch from @raycast/utils for accessing remote APIs.
- Use environment.canAccess from @raycast/api to check API access.
- Use getSelectedFinderItems from @raycast/api for accessing Finder selections.
