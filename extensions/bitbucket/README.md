## Features

- Quick access to your repositories
- Search your recent pipelines and see their status
- See your recent open pull requests

## Getting started

- Go to to your Bitbucket Cloud profile, [under App Passwords](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/)
- Click on `Create App Password`
- Give your App password a name e.g. `Raycast`, and select all the read options you need (Account, projects, repositories, Pull Requests, Pipelines)
- Store in a secure location the given App Password
- Start a bitbucket command and fill the required fields:
  - Workspace: You can see your workspaces [here](https://bitbucket.org/account/workspaces/), and use the slug. You can find it in the URL of your workspace: `https://bitbucket.org/{organization}/`
  - Account Name: You can find it [here](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/) under `Bitbucket profile settings > Username`
  - App Password

Now you should be able to run Bitbucket commands with Raycast ðŸš€.

## Roadmap

- [x] Use the Bitbucket Client NPM package instead of hardcoding the API
- [x] Show commit name in pipelines title
- [x] Addd pagination navigation to pipelines
- [ ] Dashboard with overview of differents queries (PRs, pipelines, etc)
- [ ] Extend pipelines capabilities to see logs & rerun a failed/stopped one
- [ ] Test performances with high number of repositories (only tested with 38 until now). And if bad performances, check:
  - [ ] Add pagination navigation to repositories
  - [ ] Load all repos in background and keep a cache of all of them (as repositories are quite static resources)
  - [ ] Only keep the field needed, to reduce JSON answer size
