# Harvest Extension

To use this extension, you need to enter your Personal access token and Account ID from your Harvest account, which can be found [here](https://id.getharvest.com/developers).

On this screen, click **Create new personal access token** and give it a name so you can recognize it later, like "Raycast". This extension is only compatible with a single Harvest account and does not support Forecast accounts. If you have multiple accounts, be sure to select the correct Harvest account to find your account ID.
