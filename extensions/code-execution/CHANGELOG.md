# Code Execution Changelog

## [Python Modules & AppleScript] - December 7, 2024

With this update, Code Execution now has the full powers of Python Modules, the Command Line, and also AppleScript. Anything you can dream, Code Execution can do.

### What's New?

* üçé **AppleScript Support**: Code Execution can now write and run AppleScript, to automate system tasks
* üêç **A Better Python**: Code Execution now automatically uses *your* Python installation, instead of the macOS Python installation, which allows things like using Modules
* üì¶ **Automatic Module Installation**: When Code Execution fails to run Python because a module is missing, it'll automagically suggest to install the modules with a Bash script!

### Other Changes

* Both Bash and Python tools now take `$PATH` from your default non-interactive shell
* There are new, clearer icons for Bash, Python, and AppleScript tools so that the language you are running is clear on a glance
