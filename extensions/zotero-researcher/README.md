## Privacy

This extension only connects to your local Zotero database and does not send any data to external servers. Your research library remains private and secure on your own computer.

## Troubleshooting

- **Extension doesn't show my Zotero library**: Make sure Zotero is installed and has been run at least once to create the database.
- **Missing collections or items**: The extension reads your Zotero SQLite database directly. Make sure Zotero is closed or not actively writing to the database when using the extension.
- **Performance issues**: If you have a very large Zotero library, initial loading might take a moment.

## Development

This extension is built with:
- [Raycast API](https://developers.raycast.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for database access
