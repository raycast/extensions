Finalization and Polish

Let's finalize the extension with polish and refinements to prepare it for publication.

Please implement:

1. Code cleanup and organization
2. Comprehensive README with:
   - Clear installation instructions
   - How to obtain a Zotero API key
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting tips
3. Store listing materials:
   - Description
   - Screenshots
   - Categories and tags
4. Final tests across different scenarios

Also, ensure that the extension follows all Raycast guidelines:
- Action naming uses Title Case
- Icons are consistent
- Error handling follows best practices
- Preferences are properly implemented

This is the final polish pass before submission to the Raycast store.

This final prompt focuses on polishing the extension and preparing it for publication. It's sequenced last because it addresses the refinements needed after all functional components are working properly. This step ensures the extension provides a professional, polished experience and follows all Raycast guidelines for store publication.
