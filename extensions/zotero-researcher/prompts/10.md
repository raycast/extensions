Performance Optimization

Let's optimize the performance of our extension, particularly for users with large Zotero libraries.

Please implement:

1. Debounced search to avoid excessive API calls
2. Efficient pagination handling for large result sets
3. Optimization of the rendering performance for long lists
4. Proper loading states during searches and data fetching

Make sure the extension remains responsive even with thousands of citations in the user's library. Consider implementing:
- Virtual list rendering for large datasets
- Progressive loading of search results
- Cancelable requests when search terms change quickly

Test with large mock datasets to ensure performance is acceptable.

This prompt addresses performance optimization. We've sequenced it here because it builds on the functioning application we now have. Performance optimization is typically best done after basic functionality is working, as it allows us to identify and address real bottlenecks rather than optimizing prematurely.
