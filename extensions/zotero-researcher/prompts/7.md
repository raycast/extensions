Citation Formatting Implementation

Let's implement the citation formatting functionality to generate APA style citations.

Please create:

1. A formatting utility module with functions for:
   - formatInTextCitation(item: ZoteroItem): string 
   - formatBibliographyEntry(item: ZoteroItem): string
2. Helper functions for handling author names, dates, and titles according to APA style
3. Unit tests for the formatting functions with various citation scenarios

The APA formatting should follow the 7th edition guidelines. Make sure to handle edge cases like:
- Multiple authors (up to 5 before using "et al.")
- Missing information (dates, authors, etc.)
- Different types of references (books, journal articles, websites, etc.)

The formatting utility should be pure functions that don't depend on external state, making them easy to test and reuse.

This prompt focuses on the citation formatting logic, which is a core feature of the extension. We're implementing this now because it's an isolated component that can be developed and tested independently. With this in place, we can connect it to the UI and API client in the next steps to create a fully functional system.
