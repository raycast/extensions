Preferences Implementation

Now, let's implement the preferences system to allow users to enter their Zotero API key.

Please create:

1. A preferences.ts file defining the preferences schema
2. The API key preference with:
   - required: true flag
   - Appropriate description and placeholder text
   - Validation hints
3. Helper function to access preferences in components
4. Integration in the main command to check for the API key

Follow Raycast's guidelines for preferences, ensuring we don't use Keychain (as mentioned in the docs). Make sure the preference is marked as required so Raycast will prompt users to enter it before using the extension.

This prompt builds the configuration system. It's sequenced here because it's a foundational piece that doesn't depend on other components, but will be needed by subsequent steps. Setting up preferences early allows us to test the user experience of configuring the extension before implementing the functionality that depends on those settings.
