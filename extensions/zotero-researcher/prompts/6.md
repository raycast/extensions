Connect Zotero API Client

Now it's time to implement the actual Zotero API calls in our service class.

Please implement:

1. The getUserLibrary() method to fetch the user's library items from Zotero
2. The searchItems() method to search for specific items
3. Proper error handling for API responses
4. Pagination handling for large libraries
5. Authentication header setup using the API key from preferences

Use fetch or axios for HTTP requests. Implement proper error handling with informative error messages. Make sure to handle rate limiting and other potential API issues gracefully.

For pagination, implement a strategy that can efficiently load large libraries without overwhelming the API or the UI.

Add unit tests that mock the API responses to ensure the client works correctly.

This prompt implements the real API integration. We're doing this after the UI structure because now we can immediately connect the API client to the UI components we've already built. This approach allows us to see real results quickly after implementing the API calls, providing better feedback during development.
