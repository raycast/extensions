Zotero API Types and Interfaces

Now that we have our basic extension scaffold, let's define the data types and interfaces we'll need for working with the Zotero API.

Please create:

1. Interface definitions for Zotero items (particularly focusing on publications like journal articles, books, etc.)
2. Types for authors/creators
3. Interface for API responses (including pagination metadata)
4. Types for the different citation formats we'll support (in-text and bibliography)

These interfaces should be comprehensive enough to support APA formatting requirements. Place these in a "types" folder to keep our code organized.

Example of what a ZoteroItem interface might include:
- id: string
- key: string
- title: string
- creators: Array of author objects
- date: string
- publicationTitle: string
- etc.

This prompt establishes the type system we'll use throughout the app. It's important to define these types early as they'll form the foundation of our data handling. This step doesn't involve any actual API calls yet, so it's a safe, isolated step that will help us with TypeScript type checking in all subsequent development.
