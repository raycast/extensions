Connect UI, API, and Formatting

Now let's connect all the pieces we've built so far: the UI, API client, and formatting utilities.

Please implement:

1. Update the main command to use the real ZoteroService
2. Connect the search bar to the searchItems() method
3. Implement the ActionPanel with:
   - "Copy In-text Citation" action using formatInTextCitation()
   - "Copy Bibliography Entry" action using formatBibliographyEntry()
   - "Open in Zotero" action with the appropriate URL scheme
4. Add clipboard integration to copy the formatted citations
5. Add toast notifications for feedback when actions are performed

Make sure to handle loading states appropriately when fetching data, and provide helpful error messages if anything goes wrong.

Test the complete flow from searching to copying a citation.

This prompt integrates all the previously developed components. We've sequenced it here because now we have all the necessary pieces built and tested individually. This integration step creates a functioning MVP that users can actually test, allowing us to gather feedback before adding more advanced features.
