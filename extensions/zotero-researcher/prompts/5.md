Main UI Structure

Let's implement the main UI structure for our extension using Raycast's components.

Please create:

1. A List component as the main interface
2. SearchBar integration for filtering citations
3. List.Item components for displaying citation information (use mock data for now)
4. Loading states and empty states
5. Basic structure for the ActionPanel (without functionality yet)

The UI should display citation information clearly, showing:
- Title
- Authors
- Year
- Publication name
- Any other relevant metadata

Include proper loading states following Raycast best practices, and provide helpful empty states for when there are no results or when the user hasn't entered a search query yet.

This prompt establishes the user interface skeleton. We're building this now because it provides a visible framework that we can start testing with users, even with mock data. Having the UI structure in place will make it easier to connect real data in subsequent steps, as we'll already have the display logic established.
