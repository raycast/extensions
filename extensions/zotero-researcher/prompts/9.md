Error Handling Enhancement

Let's enhance the error handling throughout the extension to provide a better user experience.

Please implement:

1. Comprehensive error handling for all API calls
2. User-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
3. Retry functionality for failed API requests
4. Error states in the UI that guide users on how to resolve issues

Focus especially on common errors like:
- Authentication failures (invalid API key)
- Network connectivity issues
- Zotero API rate limiting or downtime
- Large library handling issues

Use Raycast's Toast API for non-disruptive error notifications, and provide inline error states within the List component when appropriate.

This prompt focuses on enhancing error handling across the app. We're addressing this now because we have a functioning application that users can test, and improving error handling will make the experience more robust. Good error handling is crucial for user trust and adoption, especially when dealing with external APIs.
