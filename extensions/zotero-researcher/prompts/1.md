Project Initialization and Setup

I'm building a Raycast extension called "Zotero Researcher" that will help users quickly insert academic citations from their Zotero library. Let's start by setting up the project structure.

Please create:

1. A basic Raycast extension scaffold with TypeScript
2. The package.json file with appropriate metadata and dependencies
3. A simple "main" command component that displays "Zotero Researcher" as a placeholder
4. The necessary folder structure for the project

The extension should follow Raycast's guidelines and best practices. For now, we just need a working shell that we can build upon.

This first prompt focuses on setting up the basic infrastructure. It's chosen as the first step because we need a working Raycast extension scaffold before we can implement any functionality. Starting with this minimal structure allows us to establish the development environment and ensure our tooling works properly.
