Zotero API Client Foundation

Let's create a basic Zotero API client that we can use to communicate with the Zotero API.

Please implement:

1. A ZoteroService class that will handle API requests
2. Methods for authentication using an API key
3. Basic method stubs for:
   - getUserLibrary(): Promise<ZoteroItem[]>
   - searchItems(query: string): Promise<ZoteroItem[]>
4. Error handling utilities for API requests
5. Unit tests for the service

Don't implement the actual API calls yet, just create the structure with mock returns. We want to establish the API interface first before implementing the actual HTTP requests.

Use best practices for separating concerns and making the code testable.

This prompt focuses on creating the API client structure without implementing actual network calls. By starting with mock data, we can develop and test other parts of the application without requiring actual API credentials. This approach follows the dependency inversion principle, allowing us to build higher-level components before finalizing lower-level details.
