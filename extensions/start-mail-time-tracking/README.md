## Browser Support

This extension works with most browsers, but has different levels of support:

### Full Support (AppleScript + Browser Extension)
- **Chrome, Safari, Brave, Edge, Arc, Vivaldi, Opera, Orion, SigmaOS, Yandex Browser**
- These browsers work out of the box with AppleScript automation

### Limited Support (Browser Extension Only)
- **Dia, Firefox, and other browsers without AppleScript support**
- Requires the [Raycast Browser Extension](https://www.raycast.com/browser-extension) to be installed

### Installing the Browser Extension

For browsers like Dia that don't support AppleScript, install the Raycast Browser Extension:

1. Visit [raycast.com/browser-extension](https://www.raycast.com/browser-extension)
2. Install the extension for your browser
3. The extension will automatically detect Gmail tabs and extract email subjects

## Usage

1. Open Gmail in any supported browser
2. Navigate to an email thread
3. Run the Raycast command "Start Mail Time Tracking"
4. The email subject will be copied and used to start time tracking

## Troubleshooting

- **"Couldn't find Gmail subject"**: Make sure you're on a Gmail page (mail.google.com)
- **Dia browser issues**: Install the Raycast Browser Extension for better support
- **Other browsers**: Try installing the Browser Extension if AppleScript doesn't work
