## Getting set up
In order to get your Oura data directly available in Raycast, follow these steps:
1. Visit [Oura on the web](https://cloud.ouraring.com/user/sign-in)
2. From there, click the "Developer" icon in the bottom right. It looks like this "</>".
3. You'll land on a "Cloud API for Developers" page. Don't worry if you're not sure what this is. Select "Personal Access Tokens" in the side navigation.
4. Select the "Create New Personal Access Token" button. 
5. This will create a new token that will be used to securely interact with Oura's service. Keep it secret, and keep it safe! You will lose access to the full token after leaving this page, so make sure you have it jotted down, or you will need to create a new one.
6. Paste this access token into the "Oura Personal Access Token" field under this extension's settings panel.
7. You should be good to go!
