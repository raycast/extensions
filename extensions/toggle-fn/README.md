# Toggle Fn

A Raycast extension to quickly toggle the "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" option in macOS System Settings.

## Installation

Install this extension from the [Raycast Store](https://www.raycast.com/store) or run:

```bash
npm install -g @raycast/api && npx @raycast/api publish
```

## Usage

1. Open Raycast (âŒ˜ + Space)
2. Type "Toggle Fn" or "Function Keys"
3. Press Enter to toggle the setting
4. You'll see a notification confirming the change

## Features

- **Quick Toggle**: Instantly switch between function keys and media keys mode
- **Visual Feedback**: System notifications provide essential feedback
- **System Integration**: Works directly with macOS System Settings
