# Tana extension for Raycast

## Commands

### Quick Add

Write a note in Raycast and and send it to Tana! The note that you write will be added to a node that you configure.

To configure this in Raycast, you'll need to provide an API token which can be generated in Tana. To generate this token, open the command line (Cmd/Ctrl-K) and select `Get API Token`. This will generate a token and add it your clipboard. Once generated, paste the token into the corresponding configuration in Raycast.

*Note: currently only plaintext notes are supported.*
