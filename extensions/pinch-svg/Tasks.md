# Tasks

### Done

- [x] Create an SVG Rectangle based on pixel values.
- [x] Copy the SVG to the clipboard.
- [x] Create a grid of selectable SVGs at different sizes, based on an 8px grid system.
- [x] Create a theme toggle with options for color/hue selection.
- [x] Create a toggle to change the grid system from 8 pts to another value, e.g., 5 pts.

### Now

- [x] Copy all increments to the clipboard.
- [ ] Improve some of the language within the extension, leveraging [this article as a resource](https://www.designsystems.com/space-grids-and-layouts/#:~:text=You%E2%80%99ll%20see%204pt%2C%205pt%2C%206pt%2C%208pt%2C%2010pt%20increment%20systems.).

### Next.

- [ ] All increments put some of the stroke to the outside. Figure out a way to put the stroke on the inside of the shape. So far it seems like this isn't possible with SVGs [see stack overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7241393/can-you-control-how-an-svgs-stroke-width-is-drawn).
- [ ] Enable copying as HTML/CSS in addition to SVG.
- [ ] Implement copying as a Figma Frame (AutoLayout Component).
- [ ] Create and store user preferences for color, font, etc.
- [ ] Add an option to generate a grid system based on user preferences.
