# Rubygem Documentation Browser

This Raycast extension is designed for companies and individuals hosting their
own private Rubygems repository. It enables quick access to a specific Gem's
documentation in your browser. The extension supports both private and public
Gems and is configurable to suit your specific Gem repository setup.

## Prerequisites

You need a bare Gem repository that is accessible via HTTP(S) without
authentication. It must include the `names` file, which is automatically
generated by Rubygems.

## Configuration Options

### Gems URL

This is the URL to your `names` file, e.g., `https://gems.example.org/names`. It
is used to query the list of available Gems.

### Public Gem Documentation URL Pattern

This URL pattern is used to look up documentation for **public** Gems (i.e.,
Gems hosted on rubygems.org). The placeholder `%gem%` will be replaced with the
respective Gem name. By default, this is set to `https://gem.wtf/%gem%`, which
supports all publicly hosted Gems and redirects to a Gem's documentation
(typically a GitHub repository displaying the README).

### Private Gem Documentation URL Pattern

This URL pattern is used to look up documentation for your **private** Gems. The
placeholder `%gem%` is replaced with the respective Gem name. Example:
`https://gem-docs.example.org/%gem%/current`.

Omit this setting if you do not have any private Gems.

### Private Gem Prefix

If provided, any Gem name starting with this prefix will be considered **private**, and the configured "Private Gem Documentation URL Pattern" will be used to look it up.
Example: `my_company_`.

You can also whitelist additional Gems that do not match this prefix using the
"Private Gems" setting.

Omit this setting if you do not have any private Gems.

### Private Gems

This setting accepts a comma-separated list of Gems that should be considered
**private**, using the configured "Private Gem Documentation URL Pattern".
Example: `gem1,gem2`.

Omit this setting if you do not have any private Gems.

## Tip

In your Raycast settings under "Extensions", set an **Alias** (e.g., `gem`) for
the command provided by this extension. This allows you to simply enter
something like `gem mygem`, press Return, and voilà — the Gem documentation
opens.
