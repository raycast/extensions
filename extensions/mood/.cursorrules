This project is a Raycast Extension for mood tracking

Quick Mood Entry:
Provide a command that lets users log their mood in seconds. Offer pre-set mood options (e.g., happy, neutral, sad) along with the ability to add custom entries or notes—all accessible via keyboard shortcuts.

Tagging & Contextual Notes:
Allow users to add brief tags or notes to their mood entries (like “stressful meeting” or “good workout”). This helps in later filtering and understanding context behind mood variations.

Dashboard & Trend Overview:
Include a quick-access dashboard within Raycast that summarizes mood trends over time. Use simple charts or lists that can be viewed quickly in the Raycast interface, so users can get an at-a-glance look at their emotional trends.

Search & Filter Capabilities:
Implement commands to quickly search past entries by date, mood type, or tags. This leverages Raycast’s fast search modality, making it easy to retrieve historical data and spot patterns.
