# Conventional Commits

![Example of the list of commands available](./screenshots/cc-screenshot-2.png)

A [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) extension designed to provide a reference list of the possible [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) prefixes enriched by the [Angular Convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) which can be inserted into the active window.

Each prefix contains a brief description explaining a typical usecase, once selected Raycast inserts the prefix into your current text field.
