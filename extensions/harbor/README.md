# Harbor ðŸš¢

> See which ports are exposed by your devlopment processes and act on them.

Imagine you're a developer that needs to set up multiple devservers to run his app locally. E.g: a server that serves the client side app, and another for the API server etc.
With **Harbor** you can easily see which devservers are running right in your _Menu Bar_!

## Preferences

* `hideByArgs`: command separated string list.
  * Allows you to hide certain processes by their command line args.
  * Useful for long running processes that are not related to your devservers.
