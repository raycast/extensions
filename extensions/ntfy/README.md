# Ntfy - Raycast extension

Send notifications to your devices using ntfy.sh
For more information visit their [documentation][ntfy-doc]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Topics on ntfy.sh are public by default.

## Configuration

Set a topic that is difficult to guess to avoid your notifications being delivered to others.

I suggest generating a random id with [nanoid][nanoid-gen]
> Example: ygJYwllDVqbY_I-iI0YVG

Then install the [ntfy app][ntfy-app] and subscribe to the topic on your phone.

## Privacy and self-hosting

Ntfy.sh is a public service, but you can also [host your own server][ntfy-self-host].
For a fast way to setup the server I suggest trying their [Docker image][ntfy-docker].

## Roadmap

This tool is meant to give quick basic access to sending notifications through [ntfy.sh][ntfy] for now, but I'm working
on additional features that may fit the usage of whoever wants this like:

- [ ] Sending attachment files through the notification
- [ ] Better customization of the notification via UI
- [ ] Configure multiple servers/topics
- [ ] Read/receive notifications on Raycast
- [ ] Contribute to [ntfy.sh][ntfy]:
  - [ ] Add support for [android intent/activity][android-intent], so we can trigger share activities and possibly more

If you have more suggestions feel free to let me know on a new [Issue][gh-feat-req].
