# raycast-bard-ai Changelog

## [Began Project!] - 2023-05-26

- Started Project!
- Added variety of Quick Actions

## [Introducing Bard Explain and Ask AI] - 2023-05-26

- Added ability to ask AI something, right from the command line. Add the "Ask AI" command (for raycast-bard-ai) to your fallback commands. Then, you can either ask AI something about your selected text, or simply just ask it about anything, right from the command line.
- Introducing Bard Explain, an all new way to use Bard from Raycast. Simply ask it any Text or Code based command (i.e. Add Comments to Code, Summarize, etc.) and Bard will now tell you what it has changed and/or done for you. This will help you better understand changes that have happened!
