# GetSound - Raycast Extension

## Overview

[GetSound.ai](http://getsound.ai/) Raycast Extension is a slimmed-down version of our main GetSound.ai app, crafted especially for Raycast Community. It provides developers and users with a convenient and straightforward way to take a break and refocus during their work. Simply type "Focus" and you can generate short, 5-10 minute, calming ambient music tracks to help you get back on track.

**What makes the full version of GetSound different?**

If you want to experience the full GetSound.ai immersive audio user experience, we suggest downloading the app from our [Website](https://getsound.ai). 
Unlike the slimmed-down Raycast version, the full app features GetSound's unique RTS (Real-Time Soundscape) algorithm, which creates ambient music based on your environment. Factors such as weather, location, and time of day all contribute to creating a unique soundscape in that moment. So, if you want to meditate, relax, or stay inside on a rainy day, GetSound will generate the perfect soundtrack and keep playing new music for as long as you like. Plus, you'll enjoy these key features:
* Enjoy continuous, uninterrupted and non-repeated soundscape music 24/7.
* Hi-resolution audio quality.
* Add and control extra layers of environmental effects, such as rivers, oceans, lakes, waterfalls, coffee shops, and more.
* Change your location to generate more unique soundscapes.
* Refresh funtion to regenerate new real-time soundscapes.
* Weather Sync - This feature will be available only when certain weather conditions, like rain, storms, and winds, occur at your location. You can easily adjust the volume to your liking.
* Timer Session - Do you have limited time to meditate or relax? With this feature, you can set the music to fade out after a set amount of time. Perfect for those with 15 minutes or less to spare.

## Installation

Install the [GetSound.ai](http://getsound.ai/) Raycast Extension from the Raycast Store.
