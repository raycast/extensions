# Defly.io

**This extension allows users to see who is currently playing [defly.io](https://defly.io).**

- It works for the 'teams' and 'defuse' game-modes.
- You can select the server by either using the command arguments or changing the current server with `cmd p`. There, you can search for servers by either searching the name of the server and game-mode or using a shortcut like `use3005`, `usw3002`, `eu3015`, `au3002`, or `tr3009`.
- You can search for players that include a certain player name by using the `Search players...` bar at the top.
