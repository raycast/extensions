## [Snake and 2048 Update] - 2023-08-13

✨ It's update time! Get ready for new features, new games, fixes, and more...

### Game Search

Don't want to have all of the games cluttering your Raycast? Introducing Game Search, a centralized place to access all your games. Read a bit about the game, see highlights, and more!

Games are still available as commands, so you can pick and choose by disabiling them in Raycast Settings.

### New Games

- 🔢 **2048**: The number merging game you just can't miss! The beautiful design is nearly identical to the original, and you're sure to have a blast with this one.

- 🐍 **Snake**: Have fun navigating your snake through a board to grab apples! Try not to hit the walls or your own tail, though!

### New Features

- 🎨 **Game Icons**: Each game now has its unique icon... huge thank-you to Krishna AR on Slack for designing the original icons!
- 🟩 **Wordle**: Grab your dictionary, because Wordle just got better. By an Unlimited amount! Play Wordle infinitely in the new mode, and check statistics on both modes with the new Statistics tab!

### Improvements and Fixes

- **Actions Icons, Action Icons Everywhere!**: Now, every Action has an Icon too!
- **Dino Crash**: Holding down enter in the Chrome Dinosaur game causes it to crash... and even freeze your Mac. Now its fixed! Thanks to Danylo Zalizchuk on Slack for reporting this issue!

We hope you enjoy this new update, and have fun in the Arcade!
