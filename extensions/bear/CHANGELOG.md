## [Make opening notes in edit mode optional] - 2022-10-01

- Add a checkbox to enable or disable "edit mode" when opening notes in Bear. Edit mode places the cursor at the end of the note, which is sometimes desirable, and sometimes not. Previously, notes would always be opened in edit mode. Now, you can disable that behavior by unchecking the checkbox.
