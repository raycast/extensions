# One Thing

Put a single task or goal in your menu bar.

This can be a useful tool to help you focus on a single task.

Some examples of what you could write:

- Eat more healthily
- Exercise
- Reply to Sarahâ€™s email
- Be happy
- Stop procrastinating
- Finish the ðŸ¦„ project
- Important meeting today

However, what you use this space for is really up to you.

> You can achieve almost anything in life â€” as long as you focus on achieving one thing at a time. Itâ€™s a time-tested strategy thatâ€™s been shared by many successful people.
