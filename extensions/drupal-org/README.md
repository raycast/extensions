# Information from drupal.org

Easily access information from drupal.org to speed up development.

## Available commands

### Search for Drupal Change Records

![Search for Drupal Change Records](metadata/drupal-org-1.png)

This command lets you search for Drupal Change Records. It will return the first page of results from the [change records](https://www.drupal.org/list-changes/drupal) and also search based on keywords. You can open the change record in the browser by pressing Enter.

## Future commands

I want to make available a lot more drupal.org features and information such as modules, themes, documentation, and so on. This is a list of commands I will implement in the future.

[x] Search for Drupal Change Records
[ ] Search for projects
[ ] Show information and releases for a project (module, theme, distribution, etc)

Ideas are welcome. Please create [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/hussainweb/raycast-drupal-org/issues) for them or [find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hussainweb).
