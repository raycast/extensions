# RescueTime Focus Session Trigger
This Raycast extension provides commands to start and end Focus Sessions in RescueTime. You will need the paid version of RescueTime to use Focus Sessions.

## API Key
You will need an API key from RescueTime. Log into your RescueTime account in a browser and then navigate to https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/manage to generate an API Key and add it into this extension's preferences.

Note: The desktop app checks for updates once every minute, so your trigger may not immediately be reflected.

## Default Focus Session Duration
Be sure to set your own default Focus Session duration in this extension's preferences if you prefer a duration other than 25 minutes.
