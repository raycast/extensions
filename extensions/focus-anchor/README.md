# Focus Anchor

[Focus Anchor](https://focusanchor.com) helps you stay focused on your most important thing.

You can install Focus Anchor to your computer from [focusanchor.com](https://focusanchor.com).




## Tips

- There is only ever _one_ 'most important thing'. Anchor your focus on that, work at it until it's done, then choose the next most important thing & repeat.

- Multi-tasking is a myth. Single-task on what is most important now. Sequence your work so you're *completing* one task after another, rather than moving forward 12 a tiny amount and achieving nothing.
