# Jokes

This is a Raycast extension to get jokes via [JokeApi v2](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/).

## ⚙️ Preferences
- By default, the extension will use "Safe Mode" to serve only jokes that are considered safe for everyone. However, you can disable this in Preferences (NOTE: Safe Mode overrides all other flags).

- After disabling Safe Mode, you can enable the kind of jokes you want by checking the relevant preference.

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

Neither `Raycast` nor the author `xmok` are affiliated with JokeAPI v2 so for any complaints or issues with the content of the jokes themselves, please contact the API author via [JokeApi v2](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) site.
