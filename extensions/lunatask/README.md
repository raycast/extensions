# Lunatask

## Configuration

The first time you run any command, you'll be asked to define the Access Token and the Default Area ID.

We recommend creating an ["Inbox" area](https://lunatask.app/docs/how-to/implement-inbox-pattern) (you can name it anything you'd like) so that all tasks flow there for later processing.

[See here how to get your Access Token and Area ID in Lunatask.](https://lunatask.app/docs/features/tasks/integrations/browser-bookmarklet#where-can-i-find-the-access-token)

You can also add additional areas after the initial configuration by running the command `Add New Area`.
