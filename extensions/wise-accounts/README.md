# Wise Profiles

Fetch and review Wise profiles, balances, and transactions.

> :warning: This project uses the Wise API to fetch user data. Please note that the use of the Wise API (READ-ONLY) is subject to the Wise Terms of Use. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Wise. Please use this project responsibly and do not abuse the Wise API or violate any of their terms and conditions.

## Configuration

The extension requires a Wise API key for your account to fetch personal information. Only the ``READ-ONLY`` version of the key is recommended as this extension does not perform any operation.

The `Main Profile ID` can be configured later, it is only required when running the `Display Balances and Today's Transactions` menu bar command. The ID can be set by first running the `Get Profiles` and using the shortcut to `Copy Profile ID and Open Preference` and paste it onto the `Main Profile ID` field.
