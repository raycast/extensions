# Sleet Hello

A hello extension by Sleet for interacting with the near blockchain.

> this app uses near api js, but makes use of near cli credidentials for signing trasactions
> i also called this a hello extention for a lack of a better name, but it has a lot of commands and examples of what is possible to do with near api js and near blockchain.
