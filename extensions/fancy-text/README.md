# Fancy Fonts

The fastest fancy text generator for macOS. Turn your normal text into fancy text!

Some examples:

> 𝚂𝚝𝚊𝚢 𝚒𝚗 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚏𝚕𝚘𝚠

> 𝕾𝖙𝖆𝖞 𝖎𝖓 𝖙𝖍𝖊 𝖋𝖑𝖔𝖜

> S̶t̶̶a̶y̶ i̶n̶ t̶h̶e̶ f̶l̶o̶w̶

> 𝒮𝓉𝒶𝓎 𝒾𝓃 𝓉𝒽ℯ 𝒻𝓁ℴ𝓌

This extension converts your text by using pseudofonts made with unicode characters.

_Note:_ Some of these fonts might not be recognizable by screen-readers. So please use them with care.
