# Comet Extension for Raycast

Welcome to the official Comet browser extension for Raycast! This extension provides a seamless bridge between Raycast and the Comet browser, allowing you to manage tabs, search your history, and find bookmarks without leaving your keyboard.

## Features

- **New Tab Command**: A central hub to see your currently open tabs and recent history at a glance. You can also type to immediately search or enter a URL to open a new tab.
- **Search All**: A powerful command to search through your entire Comet history and all your bookmarks simultaneously.
- **Search Bookmarks**: Quickly find and open any of your Comet bookmarks.
- **Search History**: Search your complete Browse history.
- **Window Management**: Commands to instantly open a new regular or incognito window.

## Setup

This extension requires access to Comet's local history database to provide the "Search History" and "Search All" features.

When you run either of these commands for the first time, Raycast will prompt you to grant Full Disk Access. This is a standard macOS security requirement, and your data is processed locally and is never sent to Raycast or any third party.
