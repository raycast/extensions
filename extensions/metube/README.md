# MeTube

Download videos from YouTube and other services through yt-dlp using MeTube.

### Current features:
- Set default settings for Format and Quality
- Quickly add your clipboard to MeTube
- Add a link through a form, specifying Format and Quality

### TODO:
- Listing progress and history of downloads
- Validating links beforehand (maybe)

## Requirements
You need to have [MeTube](https://github.com/alexta69/metube) installed, obviously :)
