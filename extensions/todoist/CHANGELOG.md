# Todoist Changelog

## [View task in Raycast from menu bar] - 2023-06-29

When using menu bar you may want to take a closer a look at your task description without opening the Todoist app. This change adds a way to quickly preview any task from menu bar on Raycast floating window.

It also enhances user experience in the following ways:
- Add subtask count to the task detail view in Raycast, so you can quickly see how many subtasks you have for each task.
- Fix null issue when Editing task without changing any field (#7057)
- Truncate menu bar task content to 50 characters to improve user experience.

Happy viewing!


## [Subtasks on menu bar] - 2023-06-14

This update adds subtasks to the menu bar tasks options. Thanks to this change, you can now break down tasks on the app and work on them one step at a time while still using the menu bar for navigation.

Happy task breaking!

## [Show task count for projects] - 2023-06-07

This update adds a new feature to display the `task count` besides project name  in the `Show Projects` view. Note it's set to off by default in the command's preferences.  


## [Filter view menu bar] - 2023-06-05

This updates adds a new view on menu bar called filter. When set, you can specify a custom [Filter Query](https://todoist.com/help/articles/205248842) to only show those tasks that matter the most to you in the menu bar.


It also improves user experience by addressing the following bugs:
- Fix an issue grouping tasks by due date when local is not UTC.

Happy filtering!

## [Search command and bug fixes] - 2023-06-02

This update adds a new command called `Search`, allowing you to search among your Todoist tasks, projects, labels, and comments. Please note that the `All Tasks` view of the `Home` command has been moved to the `Search` command.

It also enhances the user experience by addressing and fixing several bugs:
- The `JS heap out of memory error` in the menu bar has been resolved (still not the case for other commands)
- The ability to focus on tasks outside the menu bar tasks has been added for improved usability
- The `Quick Add Task` command now works properly a fallback command
- The dates with a datetime should be placed in full dates sections

Happy searching!

## [Todoist v2] - 2023-05-12

The Todoist extension has been completely revamped for a cleaner, better and smoother Raycast experience. The goal of this extension is clear: make you able to use Todoist anytime, anywhere, for anything on your computer using the power of Raycast. This update is packed with new features, so let's jump right into them.

### Home Command

Exit `Today Tasks`, `Upcoming Tasks`, `Search Tasks`, `Completed Tasks`. Welcome `Home`. This brand new command allows you to see your different tasks views from within one command: inbox, today, upcoming, completed but also your project and labels views. Then, switch views very easily using `‚åò` + `P`. Need a quick-access to a view? Select your favorite view, and press the `Create View Quicklink` action. Note it's also possible to configure the default view in the command's preferences.

### OAuth Integration

To start using the extension, you previously had to go to Todoist settings, then the developer section and then get your API key. That's not the best experience when using an extension. Now? Just connect your Todoist account with the new OAuth integration. Note that if you were using the token previously, you should stay logged in without any problems.

### Better performance and always fresh data

Navigating across the extension is now smoother and faster. Plus, your data can stay always fresh by activating the `Background Refresh` option in the `Menu Bar Tasks` command. This has been made possible by using Todoist's Sync API instead of the REST API. The Sync API is actually used by Todoist's own clients and also unlocks ton of new features, which brings us to the next feature...


### Assignee Support

Assignees are coming to the extension! It's now possible to see who's responsible for each task directly from Raycast but also who assigned you the task and the comment's authors. You can also assign a task to anyone and create a task with an assignee.

### Flexible Grouping and Sorting

One of the power of Todoist is being able to group and sort your different tasks views by due date, assignee, label, or priority. Well, why not do the same? Make use of the `Group By` action ( `‚å•` + `‚áß` + `G`), `Sort By` action (`‚å•` + `‚áß` + `S`), and `Order By` (`‚å•` + `‚áß` + `O`) and customize your task views independently from each other, the way you want it.

### Reminders

This update also adds support for reminders. It's now possible to see a task's reminders, create time reminders (`‚åò` + `‚áß` + `R`), create location reminders (`‚å•` + `‚áß` + `R`) using your pre-defined locations list, or delete reminders (`‚åÉ` + `‚áß` + `R`). Note that you won't be able to use reminder actions if you're not using Todoist Pro.

### Attachment Support

Need a file for a particular task? You can now add a file attachment from the `Create Task` command. Of course, it's also possible to add attachments by adding a new comment to a task.

### Label Improvements

There's also significant improvements to labels with this update: introducing the `Show Labels` command. This command allows you to view all labels, add or remove them to or from favorites (`‚åò` + `‚áß` + `F`), and delete them (`‚åÉ` + `X`).

### Menu Bar improvements

The menu bar command also gets its own set of improvements:
- Hide the tasks count in the command's preferences if you want to have a cleaner (and maybe more stress-free) menu-bar
- Add a label or an assignee to a task
- Quickly access your tasks views (`Inbox`, `Today`, etc.), or other commands such as `Create Task` or `Create Project` 
- Also, some bugs have been fixed which should make the menu-bar smoother to use

### Quality of Life Improvements

This changelog is getting long, isn't it? I'd be happy to tell you more about other updates but it'd get way longer so let's just put up a list for the rest of them:
- See your sub-tasks from a task list item (`‚åò` + `‚áß` + `T`)
- See the task's project section from within the list
- Set the parent task of another task if you want to make-it a sub-task (`‚åò` + `‚áß` + `M`)
- See the different reactions to your comment
- Refresh your data with (`‚åò` + `R`)
- Better empty views (especially the today one!)
- See your team inbox in the `Show Projects` view
- Same order than Todoist in the today or upcoming view
- And other improvements and fixes I've probably forgotten.

This update paves the way for other features such as filters. I hope you enjoy it and that it'll make your Todoist experience on Raycast delightful.
