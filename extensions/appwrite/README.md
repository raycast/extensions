# Appwrite

This is a Raycast extension for [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) - Build like a team of hundreds. With this extension you can view various services in multiple Appwrite projects.

## ðŸ¤” How It Works

Since:
    
1. there can be multiple Appwrite projects with a mix of self-hosted and hosted,
2. API keys are scoped to single projects,

...the extension allows you to add each project, securely store it via Raycast LocalStorage, then view its serviecs. This means you can have, for example, 2 hosted Appwrite projects with different endpoints as well as multiple self-hosted projects.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Install extension**: Click the `Install Extension` button in the top right of [this page](https://www.raycast.com/xmok/appwrite) OR `install` via Raycast Store

2. **Configure**:

    For each project you have, run the "Projects" command and add -

    - Local Name: This can be anything you want
    - Appwrite Endpoint: This will depend on your Appwrite instance e.g. "https://REGION.cloud.appwrite.io/v1" or "https://appwrite.example.com/v1"
    - Project ID - `Get` this from Project Settings
    - API Key: `Follow` instruction from [API keys - Docs - Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/platform/api-keys)
