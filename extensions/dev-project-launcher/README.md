# Dev Project Launcher

üòé List projects, search and open it with any IDE!

## Configuration

The shortcuts will be saved into a configuration file, by default that configuration file will be in `~/.raycast_DevProjectLauncher.json`.
You can change that path after you initialize the extension for the first time and also in the extension preferences.
> **_Advice!üößüößüöß:_** Another thing that you should know is that you will probably need to give `Full Disk Access` to Raycast application, only if you want to search files and directories in your home directory.
