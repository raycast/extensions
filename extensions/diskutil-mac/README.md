# diskutil-mac

Welcome to my extention! I hope you like it :) If there is anything to improve, just contact me and I'll see what can be done

## Functionality

The usage is fairly intutive. Each disk has multiple actions in raycast which are self-explainatory and change based on the type and status of disk/volume. Just try it!

It supports a variety of diskutil related commands with a short-cut and GUI

## Approach

This extention is basically just a combination between the terminal command "diskutil" and lots of regex.
It's probably not the fastest possibility, but it provides all information provided.

A probably more performant and multiplatform approach the module INSERT_HERE. But it does not provide as much information as the diskutil command. Might be implemented as a fallback version in the future though maybe.
