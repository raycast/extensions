### Supported Languages

Currently we support 48 languages: **Chinese-Simplified, Chinese-Traditional, English, Japanese, Korean, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Russian, Arabic, Swedish, Romanian, Thai, Slovak, Dutch, Hungarian, Greek, Danish, Finnish, Polish, Czech, Turkish, Lithuanian, Latvian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Indonesian, Malay, Slovenian, Estonian, Vietnamese, Persian, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Urdu, Filipino, Khmer, Lao, Bengali, Burmese, Norwegian, Serbian, Croatian, Mongolian, Hebrew.**

#### Language Detection

Currently, we support 5 language detection APIs, including Baidu, Tencent, Volcano, Apple and Bing. Apple language detection is a macOS feature, but you need to install a shortcut to use it.

Considering user privacy, only Bing language detection is enabled by default (no App Key is required, and no user personal data is recorded!) Other language detection APIs are enabled only when the corresponding translation feature is enabled. Note, however, that in general, the more language detection APIs are enabled, the more accurate the text will be and the faster the response time will be.

Details of the languages supported by each language detection service are as follows:

> Note: ⚠️ means the translation of source language to Traditional Chinese is not supported, such as DeepL. If you enter Traditional Chinese for translation, it will be treated as Simplified Chinese.

### Preferred Languages

The default preferred languages are simplified Chinese and English. You can change them according to your preferences.

Preference language has two main functions:

<details><summary> First, it improves the accuracy of automatic detection of input text language. </summary>

<p>

Preference language will be given priority in order during automatic detection. This is because some words may represent multiple languages at the same time, and the automatic detection program cannot work as expected. In most cases, the automatic detection of input text is very useful, except for very few special cases. For example, the English word `heel` will be automatically recognized into Dutch by Youdao translation, and then the translation results are not what we expect. At this time, if your `Easydict` preferred language contains English, it will be recognized into English first and translated correctly.

</p>

</details>

<details><summary> Second, it is used to confirm your target translation language.  </summary>

<p>

For example, if you input a sentence arbitrarily, it will be translated into the first preferred language. If the automatically recognized language is the same as your first preferred language, it will be automatically translated into the second preferred language.

</p>

</details>

### Automatic Query Selected Text

<details><summary> Automatic query selected text of the frontmost application, this option is turned on by default. </summary>

<p>

In order to better match the automatic selected text feature, it is a good idea to set a hotkey for `Easydict`, such as `Cmd` + `E`, so that after selected the text, you can directly query words through the hotkey, which is very smooth and elegant.

</p>

</details>

### Automatic Play Query Word Pronunciation

<details><summary> Automatically play the word audio after querying the word, turned on by default. </summary>

<p>

Note that when this option is started, the voice will be played only when the query is judged to be `is_Word` and in English, e.g. `good`, `look for`, etc. For other queries, the voice can be played with the shortcut `Cmd + S`.

The content of playing voice: English words are pronounced by the online Youdao dictionary first, and other words are pronounced by the TTS service of Youdao translation. For long text playback, use the say command.

</p>

</details>

Use `Cmd + S` to play the pronunciation of words manually.

### Select Target Language

<details><summary> Specify the target language. This option is turned off by default. </summary>

<p>

By default, the extension will automatically select the preferred language as the target translation language. However, sometimes if you want to manually specify a language as the target language, you can turn on this option in the preferences and then you can temporarily select another target language in the action panel.

</p>

</details>

### Sort Query Results Manually

<details> <summary> You can sort query results by your preference, default is Youao Dictionary, Linguee Dictionary, DeepL, Google, Bing, Apple, Baidu, Tencent, Volcano, Youdao, Caiyun. </summary>

<p>

Name case are insensitive, use comma to separate. Example: `youdao dictionary, linguee dictionary, deepl, google, bing, apple, baidu, tencent, volcano, youdao, caiyun`.
You can also specify a part of the sort, for example: `youdao dictionary, apple, tencent`，the actual sort is: `youdao dictionary, apple, tencent, linguee dictionary, deepl, google, bing, baidu, volcano, youdao, caiyun`.

> Note: This sort is the overall sort, if a translation service is not enabled, the sort will be automatically ignored.

</p>

</details>

### 🍎 Apple Translate

`Easydict` support MacOS system translate, for more information, please see [How to use macOS Apple System Translation in Easydict?](https://github.com/tisfeng/Raycast-Easydict/blob/main/docs/How-to-use-macOS%F0%9F%8D%8Esystem-translation-in-Easydict.md)

### System Proxy

When this feature is turned on, `Easydict` will try to get the Mac system agent, and if successful, all subsequent network requests will be sent through the system agent. It is disabled by default. This feature is intended to counter IP blocking (some services such as Linguee have frequency restrictions on IPs), **but it can slow down the response time to requests, so please enable it only when needed. **

> Note ⚠️: Please don't turn on `Use System Proxy` while using the developer tools with MitM, otherwise some service requests will report certificate errors, for example: https://github.com/tisfeng/Raycast-Easydict/issues/18 .

### Use with PopClip

You need to install [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) first, then add a shortcut key for `Easydict`, such as `Cmd + E`, then you can open `Easydict` quickly with `PopClip`!

Usage: Select the following code block, `PopClip` will show "Install Easydict", just click it.

```
  # popclip
  name: Easydict
  icon: search E
  key combo: command E
```

### Translation Services

For easy to use, we provide some built-in translation APIs appid and appkey, but these Services have request frequency limits. If many people use them at the same time, it is likely to slow down or even stop. Therefore, for a better use experience, you'd better apply for a dedicated appid and appkey, and then replace the built-in services on the Preferences page.

Don't worry, these translation services have free quotas. Generally speaking, personal use is enough.

The following application tutorial is from [`Bob`](https://bobtranslate.com/guide/advance/service.html). Follow the tutorial and you should be able to complete the application soon.

- [Youdao Translate](https://bobtranslate.com/service/translate/youdao.html)： Select `text translation` and `speech synthesis`. (You will receive ¥50 experience fund)
- [Baidu Translate](https://bobtranslate.com/service/translate/baidu.html)

## Thanks

This project is inspired by [raycast-Parrot](https://github.com/Haojen/raycast-Parrot) and [Bob](https://github.com/ripperhe/Bob), and the first version is based on [raycast-Parrot](https://github.com/Haojen/raycast-Parrot). `Easydict` has improved many UI displays, added more practical features, deleted some complex or inappropriate operations, and made a lot of optimization && improvements on the original project.

Finally, all those interested in this project are welcome to contribute to the project, issues and PRs are fine. The project is still in the rapid development stage, any practical suggestions or interesting ideas are OK. There is no guarantee that they will be accepted, but they will be definitely considered. In addition, if submitting a PR, it is recommended to open a issue to briefly describe the content of the PR to avoid conflicts between PR and the features I am currently developing. Thank you.
