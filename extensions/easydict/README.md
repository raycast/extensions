### Preferred Languages

The default preferred languages are simplified Chinese and English. You can change them according to your preferences.

Preference language has two main functions:

<details>
  <summary> First, it improves the accuracy of automatic recognition of input text language. </summary>
Preference language will be given priority in order during automatic recognition. This is because some words may represent multiple languages at the same time, and the automatic recognition program cannot work as expected. In most cases, the automatic recognition of input text is very useful, except for very few special cases. For example, the English word `heel` will be automatically recognized into Dutch by Youdao translation, and then the translation results are not what we expect. At this time, if your `Easydict` preferred language contains English, it will be recognized into English first and translated correctly.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Second, it is used to confirm your target translation language.  </summary>
For example, if you input a sentence arbitrarily, it will be translated into the first preferred language. If the automatically recognized language is the same as your first preferred language, it will be automatically translated into the second preferred language.
</details>

### Automatic Query Clipboard

<details>
	<summary> Automatic query clipboard text, This option is turned on by default. </summary> 
In order to better match the automatic clipboard query feature, it is a good idea to set a hotkey for `Easydic`, such as `Shift` + `Cmd ` + `E`, so that after copying the text, you can directly query words through the hotkey, which is very smooth and elegant. 
In addition, to avoid frequently querying the same clipboard words, we set a `10 minute` limit, that is, if the latest word on the clipboard is automatically queried only once within 10 minutes, of course, you can manually paste and query at any time.
</details>
### Select Target Translation Language

<details>
  <summary> Specify the target translation language. This option is turned off by default. </summary>
By default, the extension will automatically select the preferred languages as the target translation language, but sometimes if you want to manually specify a supported language as the target language, you can turn on the option `Select Target Translation Language` on the preference page, and then you can temporarily select another target language in the action panel.
</details>

### Translation Services

For easy to use, we provide some built-in translation APIs appid and appkey, but these Services have request frequency limits. If many people use them at the same time, it is likely to slow down or even stop. Therefore, for a better use experience, you'd better apply for a dedicated appid and appkey, and then replace the built-in services on the Preferences page.

Don't worry, these translation services have free quotas. Generally speaking, personal use is enough.
