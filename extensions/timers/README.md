# Timers for Raycast

[Link to the original repo](https://github.com/ThatNerdSquared/timers-for-raycast)

This is a lightweight extension allowing you to start and stop countdown timers, stopwatches, and alarms. It works directly in Raycast, no external apps or dependencies required. Now available in the Raycast Store!

## Contributing

If you'd like to file an issue, make a feature request, or improve the code in this extension, feel free to open an issue or PR! Here are a few pieces of advice:

- Please check my [personal repo for this extension](https://github.com/ThatNerdSquared/timers-for-raycast) first as I may already be working on a fix, or there may already be an issue/PR for your idea ;) I am also more reachable there for PRs/issues.
- If you decide to file an issue on the main `raycast/extensions` repo, please ping me (`@ThatNerdSquared`) so that I don't miss your request!
- Feel free to reach out to me on the Raycast Slack (`@ThatNerd(Squared)`) if I have not responded to you in a timely manner.
- `src/hooks/useTimers.ts` contains the custom React hook that I use for state management across various commands, and `timerUtils.ts` contains backend functions I use to create the actual timer files.
- Custom timers are saved in a `customTimers.json` file as an array of [`CustomTimers`](https://github.com/ThatNerdSquared/timers-for-raycast/blob/3ea18a109a357ade47a2f854883e21c1680f497b/src/types.ts#L16), and running timers are stored as text files where the filename is `[date and time started, with illegal characters replaced with __]---[length of timer in seconds]` and the file content is a single line with the name of the timer.
- If you submit changes, please update these contributing guidelines as necessary to prevent confusion :)
