# Claude Code Session Context

## Project Overview
**Extension Name:** Randy's Text Tools  
**Purpose:** Personal Raycast extension for text insertion utilities  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/randykerber/raycast-ext  

## Commands Implemented
1. **Insert Email Address** (`insert-email`)
   - No-view command that pastes email from preferences
   - Requires email preference to be set
   - Shows success/failure toasts

2. **Insert Current Date** (`insert-date`)
   - No-view command that pastes current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Uses `toISOString().split('T')[0]` for formatting
   - Shows success/failure toasts

## Project Structure
```
src/
├── commands/           # Raycast command entry points
│   ├── insert-email.ts
│   └── insert-date.ts
├── utils/              # Generic helpers (empty)
├── logic/              # Extension-specific business logic (empty)
└── types/              # TypeScript type definitions (empty)
```

## Key Decisions Made
- **Folder organization:** Structured approach over flat src/ for maintainability
- **WebStorm integration:** Designed for good IDE experience
- **Error handling:** Comprehensive try/catch with user-friendly toasts
- **Preferences:** Email stored in Raycast preferences, not hardcoded

## Current Status
- ✅ Git repository initialized and linked to GitHub
- ✅ Project structure organized 
- ✅ Both commands implemented and configured
- ✅ Package.json updated with commands and preferences
- ⏳ Ready for WebStorm development environment
- ⏳ Ready for testing with `npm run dev`

## Next Steps
1. Open project in WebStorm
2. Run `npm install && npm run dev` 
3. Test both commands in Raycast
4. Set email preference in Raycast extension settings
5. Verify both commands work as expected
6. Push changes to GitHub

## Technical Notes
- **Node.js version:** 24.3.0 (exceeds required 22.14+)
- **Raycast API:** ^1.100.3
- **Development approach:** Hot-reloading with `ray develop`
- **No external APIs:** Both commands are self-contained
