## Credits

This extension is based on the [Folder Search](https://www.raycast.com/GastroGeek/folder-search) extension originally created by [GastroGeek](https://www.raycast.com/GastroGeek). The folder searching functionality was adapted from the original extension, while adding new capabilities for file operations.
