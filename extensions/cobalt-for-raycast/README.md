- This extension is not affiliated with Cobalt Tools.
- Instance list is fetched from [instances.cobalt.best](https://instances.cobalt.best) that mean we do not own the instances and we are not responsible for them.
- To reduce the privacy risk, we only show instances with a minimum score of 50 in the **`Convert URL to File`** command (you can change this in the extension preferences).
