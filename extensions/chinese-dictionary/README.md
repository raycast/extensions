## Motivation

When sending messages, I often try to avoid making my language too straightforward by using words that I don’t commonly use, such as “kindly request.” However, I’m sometimes unsure about the proper usage of these words, so I need to consult a dictionary. Since I don’t want to open a browser, I hope to use Raycast to look up words in the dictionary.
