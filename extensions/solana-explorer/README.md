# Solana Explorer for Raycast

![Extension Image](metadata/solana-explorer-landing.png)

A powerful Raycast extension that brings Solana blockchain exploration directly to your fingertips. This extension seamlessly integrates with Raycast to provide instant access to the Solana blockchain, allowing you to search any Solana address to view balances, transactions, and account details. Look up transaction details using transaction signatures/hashes and explore block information and contained transactions. View comprehensive token data including price, supply, and metadata, as well as access token account information and associated mint addresses. Additionally, resolve Solana Name Service (SNS) domains to their corresponding addresses and explore NFT metadata and details.

The extension supports multiple popular Solana block explorers:
- Solana Explorer (explorer.solana.com)
- Solscan (solscan.io) 
- SolanaFM (solana.fm)
- Orb (orb.helius.dev)

With configurable RPC endpoints and network switching between Mainnet, Devnet and Testnet, you have full flexibility in how you interact with the Solana blockchain. The extension provides a native Raycast experience with fast, keyboard-driven navigation and detailed formatted output for all blockchain data.

## Configuration

When you first open the extension, you will be prompted to configure the following:
- Select your default explorer (Eg. Solscan, Orb etc.)
- Configure custom RPC endpoints for each network or use the default ones

You can also change these settings later by going to the extension preferences.
