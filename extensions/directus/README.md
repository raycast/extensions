# Directus Documentation Search

When you're in the middle of sweet jam session and the code is flowing, it sucks to open a browser, type https://docs.directus.io, wait for the browser to load the page, and then still have to search for the specific Directus doc you're looking for.

Now you don't have to. Just use this Directus Raycast extension to quickly search and _hop_ into the doc you need faster than...well rabbits. üêáüê∞
