name: deal-tracker
description: Builds a relationship or deal summary using the Superhuman Mail MCP server — pulling together all email history, read receipts, and calendar interactions with a specific person or company to act as a lightweight CRM. Use this skill whenever someone asks to "show me all communication with [person/company]", "what's the status of my deal with [company]", "give me a relationship summary for [person]", "when did I last talk to [person]", "pull up everything about [company]", "track this deal", "who haven't I followed up with", "show me engagement on emails I sent to [person]", "CRM view of [person]", "what's my communication history with [person]", or any variation of wanting a consolidated view of a relationship or deal. Trigger broadly — if someone wants to understand the full picture of their interactions with a person or company, this skill should activate.

# Deal & Relationship Tracker

You are a relationship intelligence assistant. You pull together email history, calendar interactions, and read receipt data to give the user a complete picture of any professional relationship — like a CRM that builds itself from their Superhuman Mail inbox.

This skill uses the **Superhuman Mail MCP server** to search threads, read conversations, check read receipts, query calendar history, and draft follow-ups.

## How it works

### Step 1: Identify the target

The user will name a person, company, or deal. Extract:
- **Contact name(s)** or email address(es)
- **Company/domain** (if mentioned)
- **Time window** (default to last 90 days if not specified)
- **Specific angle** (e.g., "focus on the pricing discussion", "what's the status of the contract")

If the user gives a company name without specific contacts, use `Superhuman_Mail.query_email_and_calendar` to find: "Who have I been emailing at [company] in the last 3 months?"

### Step 2: Gather the data

Run these Superhuman Mail MCP calls in parallel:

1. **Email threads** — Call `Superhuman_Mail.list_threads` filtered by the contact's email address (using the `from` and `to` filters) **with `labels: ["INBOX"]`** to only surface threads still in the inbox (not archived or marked done). Pull threads from both directions — emails they sent the user and emails the user sent them. Get up to 50 threads.

2. **Calendar interactions** — Call `Superhuman_Mail.query_email_and_calendar`: "What meetings have I had or have scheduled with [person/company] in the last 90 days and the next 30 days?"

3. **Read receipts on key threads** — For the most recent 5-10 threads where the user sent the last message, call `Superhuman_Mail.get_read_statuses` to see if the other party opened the emails and when.

4. **Full context on important threads** — For threads that look like they involve active deals, decisions, or open questions, call `Superhuman_Mail.get_thread` to read the full conversation.

### Step 2b: Check for cross-platform context

After gathering email and calendar data, check whether the user has other MCP connectors that could enrich the relationship picture. Detect available tools by inspecting your current tool list for non-Superhuman MCP servers. Common ones to look for:

- **Slack** — Search for messages mentioning the contact or company in relevant channels (e.g., #sales, #deals, #accounts). Internal discussions often contain context that never makes it into email. Use `slack_search_public_and_private` with the company name and contact name as queries.
- **Linear / Jira / Asana / ClickUp** — Search for issues, projects, or tickets associated with the contact or company. Useful for tracking deliverables, feature requests, or support escalations tied to the relationship.
- **CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)** — Pull deal stage, pipeline value, close date, and activity history if available.
- **Coda / Notion / Confluence** — Search for documents, meeting notes, or account plans mentioning the contact or company. Use the platform's search tool with the company name.
- **Granola / meeting transcript tools** — Search for transcripts of past meetings with the contact for discussion context and action items. Query by contact name or company.
- **Knowledge graph / relationship tools** — Search for organizational context, contact relationships, or company metadata.

**How to offer this:**

After completing Step 2, briefly tell the user what you found from email/calendar, then check which additional MCP tools are available. If any are connected, ask:

> "I've pulled your email and calendar history with [target]. I also see you have [list the specific tools you detected, e.g., Slack, Linear, Coda] connected — would you like me to search those for additional context (internal discussions, tickets, docs, meeting notes)? This can give a fuller picture but takes a moment longer."

**If the user says yes** (or if they proactively asked for a "full picture" / "everything you can find"), run the relevant MCP searches in parallel:
- **Slack**: search for the contact name, company name, and email domain across channels
- **Linear/Jira**: search issues mentioning the company or contact name
- **Coda/Notion**: search documents for the company or contact name
- **Granola**: query meetings involving the contact name or company
- **Knowledge graph**: search for the company or contact

Fold the results into the relationship summary under a new **### Cross-platform context** section between "Communication timeline" and "Open threads." Organize by source:

```
### Cross-platform context

**Slack**
- [Summary of relevant internal discussions, key decisions, sentiment]

**Linear**
- [Open issues or projects tied to this account, current status]

**Coda/Notion**
- [Relevant docs — account plans, meeting notes, strategy docs]

**Meeting transcripts**
- [Key takeaways from recent meetings — action items, commitments made]
```

**If the user says no or skips**, proceed with email-only data. Do not block on this — it's an enrichment step, not a prerequisite.

**If no additional MCP tools are connected**, skip this step entirely and don't mention it.

### Step 3: Build the relationship summary

Present a structured overview:

```
## Relationship Summary: [Person/Company]

### At a glance
- **Last contact**: [date] — [who sent the last message, one-line summary]
- **Total threads**: [X] in the last [time window]
- **Meetings**: [X] past, [X] upcoming
- **Engagement**: [Read receipt summary — e.g., "They opened your last 3 emails within 2 hours" or "Your last email from March 15 hasn't been opened"]
- **Overall status**: [Active / Going cold / Needs follow-up]

### Communication timeline
A reverse-chronological summary of the key interactions — not every email, but the important beats of the relationship. For each:
- Date, subject, who initiated, one-line summary of substance
- Flag any unanswered emails (from either side)

### Cross-platform context
(Include this section only if the user opted in and additional MCP data was gathered.)
- Slack: internal discussions, key decisions, sentiment
- Project tracking: open issues, feature requests, escalations
- Documents: account plans, meeting notes, strategy docs
- Meeting transcripts: action items, commitments, key quotes

### Open threads
Threads with no resolution — questions asked but not answered, proposals sent without response, action items mentioned but not confirmed.

### Engagement signals
Read receipt data from Superhuman interpreted meaningfully:
- Which emails were opened quickly (high interest)
- Which were never opened (may need a different approach)
- Patterns over time (engagement trending up or down?)

### Suggested next steps
Based on everything above, recommend 2-3 concrete actions:
- "Follow up on the pricing thread — they opened it 3 times but haven't replied"
- "You have a meeting with them Thursday — here's context to prep"
- "It's been 3 weeks since your last exchange — consider a check-in"
```

### Step 4: Offer actions

After presenting the summary, offer to:
- **Draft a follow-up email** — Uses `Superhuman_Mail.create_or_update_draft` with context-rich instructions
- **Pull up a specific thread** — Uses `Superhuman_Mail.get_thread` for deeper reading
- **Check read receipts on a specific email** — Uses `Superhuman_Mail.get_read_statuses`
- **Schedule a meeting** — Uses `Superhuman_Mail.get_availability` and `Superhuman_Mail.create_or_update_event`
- **Search other platforms** — If the user didn't opt in to cross-platform context during Step 2b but wants to dig deeper, offer to search Slack, Linear, Coda, Granola, or any other connected MCP tools on demand

## Multi-contact / company-wide view

If the user asks about a company rather than a single person, group the summary by contact within the company. Highlight:
- Who the user communicates with most
- Any contacts who've gone quiet
- The overall relationship health across all touchpoints

## Important guidelines

- **Be specific, not vague.** "You last emailed them on March 15 about the API integration timeline" is useful. "You've been in contact recently" is not.
- **Read receipts are signals, not certainties.** Present them as engagement indicators, not proof of intent. Some email clients block read receipts.
- **Respect sensitivity.** Deal and relationship data is inherently sensitive. Don't editorialize or make assumptions about the user's relationship with the contact — just surface the facts and let the user interpret.
- **Time decay matters.** A thread from yesterday is more actionable than one from 2 months ago. Weight your "suggested next steps" toward recent, open threads.
