# Cloudflare

This extension allows to view your Cloudflare sites, pages, domains, and more.

To use the extension, you'll need to provide a **Global API key**. You can read more about creating and using API keys in [Cloudflare docs](https://api.cloudflare.com/#getting-started-requests). You can view your API keys in the [dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).
