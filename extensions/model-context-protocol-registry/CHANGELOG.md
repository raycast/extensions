## [Initial Version] - 2025-05-09

Initial version of the Model Context Protocol Registry. It contains two built-in registries. One with official servers and the other with community servers. Additionally, it contains a Smithery registry. The registry makes it easy to find and install MCP servers in Raycast and other apps that support the Model Context Protocol.
