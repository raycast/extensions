# Model Context Protocol Registry

This extension is a meta registry for MCP servers. It is used to discover and install MCP servers. You can install servers in Raycast but also other clients that support MCP such as Claude or Cursor.

## How to contribute?

There are three ways you can contribute to the registry:

1. Add a new MCP server to the registry.
2. Add a new MCP client to the registry.
3. Add a new MCP registry to the registry.

### Add a new MCP server to the registry

To add a new MCP server to the registry, you need to create a new entry in the `src/registries/builtin/entries.ts` file. You can add to the `OFFICIAL_ENTRIES` or `COMMUNITY_ENTRIES` array. Former is used for servers that are officially supported by the companies or makers of the service. Latter is used for community servers.

### Add a new MCP client to the registry

To add a new MCP client to the registry, you need to create a new entry in the `src/shared/mcp.ts` file. You can add to the `SUPPORTED_CLIENTS` array.

### Add a new MCP registry to the registry

To add a new MCP registry to the registry, you need to create a new entry in the `src/registries/index.ts` file. The registry is a function that returns a React component. You can add to the `REGISTRIES` array. A simple example are the built-in registries: `OfficialRegistry` and `CommunityRegistry`. A more complex example is the `SmitheryRegistry` that is used to discover MCP servers from the [Smithery](https://smithery.dev) registry.
