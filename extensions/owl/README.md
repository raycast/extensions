**OWL** is a powerful Raycast extension that helps you quickly fix mistyped text caused by typing in the wrong keyboard layout. Define your own language-to-language mappings (based on keyboard layouts), and instantly convert any selected text to the correct one using your custom mappings.

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 **Convert Text Across Keyboard Layouts**  
  Instantly translate text mistyped in one layout (e.g., QWERTY) into its intended counterpart (e.g., Hebrew, Russian, Dvorak, etc.).

- 🧩 **Custom Layout Mapping**  
  Define as many layout-to-layout conversions as you want. OWL will remember them and let you switch or correct text effortlessly.

- 🎯 **Raycast Native Integration**  
  Designed to work seamlessly with Raycast’s UX — quick, efficient, and always ready.

## 🧠 How It Works

OWL uses keyboard layout mappings to understand what character was likely intended based on key position. It doesn’t translate the language — it reinterprets the keyboard input.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can manage your layout pairs within the extension preferences. Layouts must correspond to valid keyboard configurations supported by the underlying mapping system.
