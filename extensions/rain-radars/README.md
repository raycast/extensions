## Rain Radars

A simple utility to show the local rain radar for an area.

Feel free to contribute your local rain radar.

In radars.json, add your location and image link in the following format:

```
{ "location": "Alaska, AK, USA", "url": "https://radar.weather.gov/ridge/lite/ALASKA_loop.gif" },
```
