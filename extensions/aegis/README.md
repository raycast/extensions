## Setup

Save an encrypted backup from Aegis on your phone, and transfer it to your Mac.

Currently the extension requires your backup to be encrypted, changes could be made to not require this however you really should encrypt your 2FA backups anyway.

### Notes
Thanks to the authors of the [Authy Extension](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/blob/main/extensions/authy), from where most of the code for this extension was taken and modified to work with Aegis backups as the source.
