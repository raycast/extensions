# Quick Prompt

An efficient prompt management and quick input extension for **Raycast**, integrating comprehensive features such as quick input, creation, editing, deletion, enabling/disabling, and supporting local file and remote URL data synchronization, making prompt management and input more convenient and efficient.

> Due to certain usage limitations of the [Quick Prompt browser extension](https://github.com/wenyuanw/quick-prompt), I developed this Raycast extension to enable quick insertion of prompts in any AI application and web page. Adhering to the concept of "manage once, use everywhere", it perfectly maintains compatibility with the browser plugin's data format, supporting seamless data migration through the same JSON structure.

## Features

- 🚀 **Quick Prompt Insertion**: Insert or copy the content of enabled prompts in any application with one click.
- 🗂️ **Prompt Management**: Support creating, editing, deleting, enabling/disabling prompts, and filtering and searching by tags and keywords.
- ✍️ **Quick Save Selected Text as Prompt**: Save currently selected text content in any application as a new prompt, facilitating knowledge accumulation and reuse.
- 📤 **Import/Export Functionality**: Support exporting prompts as JSON files and importing prompt data from local files or remote URLs, convenient for synchronization and backup across multiple devices.
