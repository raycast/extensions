## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> The Ente Auth [CLI](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli) is required.

## Setup
#### Adding your account
As explained [here](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli#accounts), run:
`ente account add` to login into an existing account. If you wish to update your account information, run the below:
```ente account update --app auth --email <email> --dir <path>```.

## Next Steps
#### Using Raycast
- Run `Export Secrets`. This will create a `~/Documents/ente` directory and a file named `ente_auth.txt`.
- Run `Import Secrets`. This will import all serialized items into Raycast encrypted database.
#### Using Ente
To perform a manual import, run: ```ente export```, then run `Import Secrets`.

Or perform the same actions but through the UI as long as the file is placed in the `~/Documents/ente` folder.

## Optionally
You can delete exported secrets from it's exported path by using `Delete Export`.
