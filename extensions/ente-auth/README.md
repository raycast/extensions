# Ente Auth - Raycast extension for Ente Exports

- Sorted Data: Most used TOTP codes will be displayed at the top. Use ‚åò + [Number] to select.
- Dynamic Icons: Displays service-specific favicons when URL placed in notes section.
- Metadata Display: Shows detailed metadata for each TOTP.
- Progress Indicator: Visual progress indicator for the remaining time of the current TOTP code.
- Tag Support: Displays tags associated with each TOTP secret.
- Clipboard Actions: Allows users to copy the current and next TOTP codes to the clipboard with a single click.

## üöÄ Setup

> The Ente Auth [CLI](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli) is required.

### Homebrew (Recommended)

You can install the Ente CLI using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ente-cli#default) for a simpler and more automated setup. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew install ente-cli
```

Once installed, verify the installation:

```bash
ente version
```

### Github Release (Optional)

To use the **Ente Auth** extension, you'll need the **Ente CLI**. Follow the steps below to install it:

1. Visit the [Ente CLI releases page](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/releases?q=tag%3Acli-v0).
2. Download the latest version for **macOS**.
3. Move the binary to `/usr/local/bin` and make it executable with the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo mv /path/to/ente /usr/local/bin/ente
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ente
   ```

Once installed, verify that it's working by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ente version
```

### 2. Configure Ente CLI

- Run `ente account add` to authenticate yourself with Ente CLI.
- You'll first be prompted for the app type. Enter `auth`.
- Next, you'll be asked for an export directory. You can choose any path you wish, but it must exist before you press return, else Ente CLI will not accept it.
- Finally, you'll be prompted to provide your Ente login credentials.

> To ensure the extension can import your accounts from Ente Auth, you'll need to define the "Ente CLI Export Location" when you add this extension to Raycast.
> This path should be the same one you configured when adding your Ente account.
> To show the Ente CLI's configured export path, run `ente account list` and refer to the `ExportDir` value.

## üìñ Usage Instructions

1. **Launch Raycast**

2. **Import Your Data**
   - To import your Ente Auth TOTP accounts, simply trigger the workflow by running **`Import Secrets`** in Raycast.

3. **Search for an Ente Auth TOTP account**
   - To list all of your Ente Auth TOTP accounts, run `Get TOTP`.
   - Search for a specific account.
   - You can change the preferred action when `Enter` is pressed (e.g. Paste or Copy).
   - The search supports loose search queries, matching words in the account name in any order.
      - For example "Docker Hub" will match with the queries "Docker Hub", "Hub", "Do Hu".

---

### Other Usages

- **Export Secrets** ‚Äì Creates a file named `ente_auth.txt` in the CLI‚Äôs configured export directory (`exportDir`).
- **Delete Export** ‚Äì Removes the `ente_auth.txt` file from the same directory.

### Manual Imports

To import secrets manually:

1. From your terminal, run:

   ```bash
   ente export
   ```

2. Then in Raycast, run **Import Secrets**.

Alternatively, you can perform both steps using the UI, as long as the `ente_auth.txt` file is placed in the configured export directory.

```bash
# Example of configured export path from `ente account list`
‚ùØ ente account list
Configured accounts: 1
====================================
Email:     ente@domain.com
ID:        1111111111111111
App:       auth
ExportDir: /foo/bar/ente
```

Note: In the extension preferences, **Ente CLI Export Location** refers to the `exportDir` value shown above.
