# Hide Files

Hide or unhide files in any Finder directory, including Desktop, Downloads, Documents, etc.

**Tips:**

- To use this extension, you need to give Raycast access to the Finder in **Security & Privacy**->**Automation** and **Accessibility**.

**⚠️️️Warning**

- If you move or delete the hidden file or its parent folder (causing the file path to become invalid), the hidden file will disappear from the Manage Hidden Files page.
- 🌟🌟🌟But you can always use the shortcut " **⇧+⌘+.** " or Raycast build-in **Toggle Hidden Files** command to see all system hidden files.

**⚠️️Note**

- This extension cannot hide the external disk icon
