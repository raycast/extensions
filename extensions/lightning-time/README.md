# Lightning Time

Lightning Time is a new way to measure time. It's a spin on hexadecimal timeâ€”the day is split into 16 parts, then 16 again, and so on. A typical Lightning Time string looks like `8~e~f`, or `8~e~f|b`.

Because Lightning Time is hexadecimal time, it can also be used to represent time with three colors.

This extension allows you to play around with Lightning Time via converting to/from Lightning Time and getting Lightning Time colors.
