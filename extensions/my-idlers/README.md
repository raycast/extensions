# MyIdlers

This is a Raycast extension for [MyIdlers](https://github.com/cp6/my-idlers) - a self-hosted web app for displaying, organizing and storing information about your servers (VPS/Dedi), shared & reseller hosting, seedboxes, domains, DNS and misc services.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install extension**: Click the `Install Extension` button in the top right of [this page](https://www.raycast.com/xmok/my-idlers) OR `install` via Raycast Store

2. **Get API Key**:

    a. `Navigate` to "Account"

    b. `Copy` and `Paste` the key in **Preferences**

## ⚙️ Configuration

At the moment, MyIdlers does not have a setting for "Unlimited" but some services offer "Unlimited" items e.g. _unlimited domains in hosting_. You can `check` "max_num_as_unlimited" and this will replace the max num of 999999 with the word "Unlimited".

## 🗒️ NOTE

This extension is tested to work with `Version 2.3.2`.
