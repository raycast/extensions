## Installation

To use this extension, as well as downloading the extension from the Raycast Store, you must also set up Node.js and npm, and then install the `litra` npm package by running `npm install -g litra`.

When you run the extension for the first time, you'll be prompted to provide the directory where the Litra CLI is installed. You can get this by running `dirname $(which litra-on)` from a terminal.
