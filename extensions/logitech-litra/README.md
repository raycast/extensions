*Note*: This will not work with Logitech Litra Beam devices connected using Bluetooth.

## Installation

To use this extension, as well as downloading the extension from the Raycast Store, you must also set up the [`litra` command line`](https://github.com/timrogers/litra-rs) on your machine by following the instructions in the readme. You must be running at least `v0.2.0` of `litra`.

When you run the extension for the first time, you'll be prompted to configure the path of your `litra` binary. You can get this after installation by running `which litra` in a shell.
