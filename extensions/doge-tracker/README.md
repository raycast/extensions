# Raycast DOGE Extension
Thanks to [@OxOsprey](https://github.com/0xOsprey) for the original extension!

View information about the work done by the Department of Government Efficiency. Essentially everything on the https://doge.gov website will be updated here (including, contracts, grants, leases, and payments). Let's MAKE RAYCAST GREAT AGAIN!
