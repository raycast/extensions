# Pinata

Welcome to the **_Pinata Raycast Extension_**!

Pinata is the premier Web3 media solution that allows users to host, manage and share files of any kind on the blockchain of their choice. As an IPFS pinning service, we focus on giving both technical and non-technical creators a fast, easy, and reliable way to share content without limits.

With Pinata’s Raycast extension, we’re giving our users a new and seamless way to access our services and tools. Ready to get started? Sign up for a free Pinata account [here](https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanagerager?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=raycast&utm_campaign=raycast_extension)!

After you’ve gotten set up with a Pinata account and downloaded our extension, you’ll need to follow these steps ⬇️

## Pinata API JWT

In order to access your Pinata account you will need to paste in your Pinata API key JWT. You can follow the guide [here](https://knowledge.pinata.cloud/en/articles/6191471-how-to-create-an-pinata-api-key?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=raycast&utm_campaign=raycast_extension) to get that!

## Gateway

if you want to see your files or generate links for your files, you will need to enter in an IPFS Gateway of your choice. We would recommend your [Dedicated Gateway](https://www.pinata.cloud/blog/the-power-of-dedicated-gateways?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=raycast&utm_campaign=raycast_extension&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=raycast&utm_campaign=raycast_extension) if you have a paid account which can be found [here](https://app.pinata.cloud/gateway?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=raycast&utm_campaign=raycast_extension), however, you can also use a public gateway like so:

```

```

Just keep in mind - public gateways are slower _and_ are subject to rate limiting!
