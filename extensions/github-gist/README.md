## Github Gist

## Getting Started

This extension brings GitHub Gist support to Raycast through the personal access tokens. To get started, first:

- Login to your  GitHub instance (Eg. [https://github.com](https://github.com))
- Click on your avatar image in the right upper corner
- From the dropdown menu, click on `Settings`
- On the left-hand side, click on `Developer settings`.
- On the left-hand side, click on `Personal access tokens`.
- On this page, we'll create a new access token. Click on `Generate new token` in the upper-right.
- Leave a `note` for your token (Eg. `Raycast`). This will help you identify it in the future.
- You'll need to check the following boxes to ensure this extension can perform properly:
  - `repo`
  - `gist`
  - `user`
- Click `Generate token` and save this value somewhere. **You'll only be able to see this once**.

> Future updates to this extension will offer more functionality that may require additional scopes be defined in this token.
