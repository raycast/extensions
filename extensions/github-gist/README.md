## Github Gist

### Getting Started

This extension brings GitHub Gist support to Raycast via OAuth 2.0. 

To get started, open any command and it will prompt you to connect to you GitHub instance via OAuth.
You will be led to your browser where you might need to sign in to your [github](https://github.com).
Once you accept the new/additional scopes for Raycast GitHub integration, the command will open back up 
with results. **You'll only be able to see this once**.

> If you used GitHub Personal Access Token for this extension, you can delete them after connecting through OAuth.

> Future updates to this extension will offer more functionality that may require additional scopes be defined in this token.
