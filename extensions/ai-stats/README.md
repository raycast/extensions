# AI-Stats (Raycast Extension)

## Setup

1. Install the extension in Raycast
2. Run the command: `View AI Stats`
   - Use the search list and Action menu (or Cmd+K) to switch to leaderboards.

## Preferences

You can optionally override the default read-only Supabase project via Raycast Preferences for this extension:

- `SUPABASE_URL` (textfield) – e.g., `https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (password) – your project's publishable anon key

If left empty, the extension uses a hosted, read-only Supabase instance to fetch public AI stats.

## Data Source & Configuration

- 📡 Stats come from [ArtificialAnalysis.ai](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) (via their free API) and are mirrored into a read-only Supabase database for fast, reliable queries from Raycast.
- 🔧 You can point the extension at your own Supabase project if you prefer. Configure via Raycast Preferences (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
- ⚙️ Resolution order for configuration:
  1. Raycast Preferences: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  2. Environment variables: `DEFAULT_SUPABASE_URL`, `DEFAULT_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  3. Built-in publishable read-only defaults (fastest & most reliable out-of-the-box)

## Privacy

- No account is required & no personal data is collected by this extension.
- The extension stores only local preferences (e.g., pinned models, filters) using Raycast's local storage.
- Network requests are made to a read-only Supabase endpoint to fetch public AI model data.

## Support

- Open an issue in this repository if you encounter a bug or have a feature request.
- For general questions, feel free to reach out via the Raycast Store listing.
