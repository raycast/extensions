# Govee

Control your [Govee](https://govee.com/) Lights using [Raycast](https://raycast.com).

## Usage

1. Install the Extension
2. Open the Extension and check if you see your Govee Lights in the list (network)
3. If not, check if your lights are connected to the same network as your computer and `LAN Control` is enabled
   - Open your `Govee Home App`
   - Click on the light you want to control
   - Click on the settings icon in the top right corner
   - Scroll down and enable LAN Control
   - Reload the Extension. You might need to restart the light for it to show up eventually

## Usage

### Lights

- Your device should show up in the list "Devices"
- It should indicate wether or not it is on (ðŸ’¡)
  - **Note**: This is not always accurate, sometimes it can take a while before the light synchronizes with the Extension
- On the right side it should indicate the brightness level and color
- Open `Actions` to control your light
- You can give your lights a custom name to make it easier to identify them

### Scenarios

- You can create scenarios in the Extension. This will let you control multiple lights at once
- You can set the action for all selected lights
- You can individually set the action for each light. Individually set actions will override the action for all lights.
