# Radicle Changelog

## [Fix delegate schema, add project threshold] - 2024-05-03

- With the latest rc.8 the delegates are being served with their aliases, so we don't need to fetch additionally the remotes.
- We also get the project threshold, so we can show more information related to the delegates.

## [Fix URL nodes param] - 2024-03-01

- Instead of passing only the hostname, we need to make sure to pass in hostname and port into the URL, when opening the repo in the browser.

## [Added `show` param to project listing] - 2024-02-03

- Increase `perPage` query variable to 500 overwriting the default value of 10 projects.
- Added `show` query param to project listing, to get all available projects instead of only the pinned ones.
