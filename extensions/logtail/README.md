## Usage

### Querying Logs

This extension is almost entirely reliant on the syntax for Log Tail's [Live Tail Query Language](https://betterstack.com/docs/logs/using-logtail/live-tail-query-language/)

### Log Details

Log details are customizable through the `Add Metadata Tag` and `View Metadata Tags` commands. If a key name is not found in a particular log response body it will not be show in the Log Details. Since many attributes of a log are dependent on your integration with LogTail, you can inspect the full log body to view configurable options `Copy Raw Log` action when viewing a log.
