# Raycast for FocusTask

Created by Vojtech Rinik

Bring FocusTask to Raycast so that you can manage your tasks easily. No more context-switching!

## Getting started

Before using the command, you need to retrieve your FocusTask token located in the Settings.

Then, copy it and paste it either into the extension's Welcome screen or in the extension's preferences under **FocusTask Token**.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to reach out to our support email to coordinate. Here's the roadmap for this extension:

- [ ] Action to move task to another list or column
- [ ] Action to snooze a task
- [ ] Detail view for a task (right now it just opens in browser)
- [ ] Form for creating a task (right now it just creates a task with default values)
- [ ] Action to delete a task
