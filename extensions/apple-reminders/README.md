# Apple Reminders

Manage Apple Reminders from within Raycast:
- View, complete and update your reminders
- Effortlessly create new reminders
- Manage your reminders from the menu bar

## Troubleshooting

> I can't see any reminders and get a `Failed to fetch latest data` error.

Make sure Raycast has access to your reminders in `System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security`.
