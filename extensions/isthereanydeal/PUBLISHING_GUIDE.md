## Files Ready for Submission

Your extension is fully prepared with:

- âœ… Production-ready code
- âœ… Proper TypeScript types
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation
- âœ… Correct file structure
- âœ… Valid package.json
- âœ… Proper icon sizing
- âœ… Zero linting errors
- âœ… Environment variable protection for author info

## Environment Variables Setup

Before submitting, ensure your environment variables are properly configured:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Update `.env` with your actual information:

   ```bash
   RAYCAST_AUTHOR=your_github_username
   RAYCAST_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/your_username/isthereanydeal.git
   ```

3. The `.env` file is gitignored, so your information stays private

## Security Notes

- The extension uses environment variables to protect author and repository information
- The `.env` file is excluded from git to prevent exposing your credentials
- When others fork your repository, they'll need to set up their own `.env` file
- This prevents unauthorized use of your author name or repository URL

The extension is ready for the Raycast Store! ðŸŽ‰
