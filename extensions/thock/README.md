# Thock

Control Thock with Raycast

Note: 
thock-cli is bundled automatically when you install Thock via Homebrew:
`brew install thock`

The CLI will be available globally via:
`thock-cli`

If installed manually, make sure `thock-cli` is executable and somewhere in your `$PATH`.

The error:
`/bin/sh: /opt/homebrew/bin/thock-cli: No such file or directory` is because of the above.

To solve it, install Thock using homebrew.
