# Open Graph

This is a simple Raycast extension that allows users to quickly check the Open Graph (OG) meta tags of any webpage. This tool is especially useful for developers who need to verify if the right OG tags are rendered for different pages during development, or for anyone who wishes to preview the thumbnail or other OG tag information of a website.

## Setup:

## Features:

- Fetch and display Open Graph data such as `og:image`, `og:title`, `og:description`, etc.

## How to Use:

1. Type in the URL of the website you want to check.
2. The extension will fetch and display the Open Graph data if available.
3. If no Open Graph tags are found, it will inform you accordingly.
