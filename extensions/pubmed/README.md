# PubMed

Search PubMed with [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/). If the search entry is empty, 10 Trending Articles (from [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/trending/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/trending/)) are displayed.

You can set the maximum number of results to be returned in a query with `RetMax`. The default value is 20, but it can be increased up to 100,000. Be aware that increasing RetMax may result in longer query times and higher resource usage from PubMed. It is recommended to set RetMax to a value that meets your needs without compromising the performance of the API.
