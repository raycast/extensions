# Where's Cursor Changelog

## [Big update] - 2025-09-01

General improvement with revised binary code and Raycast extension options of "Where's My Cursor" extension.

The Raycast extension allows for quick running the program through hotkeys, and also turning the effect off. It also allows for an easy way to run the Custom mode, so the user can quickly configure opacity and colors of the elements.

*   **Customizable Presets:** Comes with `default`, `presentation`, and `simple` modes, each with its own settings.
*   **On-the-Fly Configuration:** Change the appearance and behavior of the cursor highlighter without restarting the app.
*   **Command-Line Control:** Activate different modes and even create custom configurations directly from the terminal.
*   **Multi-Monitor Support:** The highlighter appears on the correct screen where your cursor is located.
*   **Lightweight:** It's a simple app with minimal resource usage.
