# Where is my Cursor

Visual aid to find cursor, specially useful when utilizing more than 1 monitor.

It calls a small swift app located at `assets/LocateCursor` that dimms the screen where the cursor's at, leaving a small clear area around it.

Additional modes allow for longer duration, an on/off toggle and a Presentation mode.

Presentation mode is also a toggle mode, it adds a yellow tint to the area around the cursor

The source code for `LocateCursor` is available on the `LocateCursor.swift` file.
