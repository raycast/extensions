- **Capture Raycast Metadata**: Capture a screenshot for Raycast Extension's metadata.

**Tips**: üåüüåüüåüHow to use **Capture Raycast Metadata**:

- Set a shortcut for this command, open Raycast, and run the command with the shortcut to take a screenshot. Screenshots will be saved in the Download directory.
- Please keep the Raycast main window visible
- Please close other Raycast windows, such as the Preferences window

**Warning**: ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èThis extension currently only works properly in some resolutions

- Due to the limitation of ScreenCapture App and Raycast's main window size being fixed at 750\*474, It only works fine when the actual resolution(Resolution) is two times the view resolution(UI Looks like). You can check the monitor screen information by typing `/usr/sbin/system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType` command in terminal.
- Devices confirmed to work properly: MacBook Pro 2019 13' built-in display, external 4K display (Resolution: 3840 x 2160,UI Looks like: 1920 x 1080).
- If the image size becomes 1000x625, please adjust the screen resolution in the system settings and then try to capture a screenshot. Or you can enlarge it twice in the Preview app or other app.

Here is the sample output of `/usr/sbin/system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType`, where **Resolution** and **UI Looks like** are the ones to watch
