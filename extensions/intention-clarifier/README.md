# Intention Clarifier

This Raycast extension is designed to assist users in clarifying their intentions and selecting appropriate moods for their tasks. It consists of two main commands: clarify-intention and select-moods. The select-moods command supports the clarify-intention command by providing a curated list of moods to enhance the intention setting process.

## Features
### Clarify Intention
Users can define a task, select relevant moods, and state their reason for the task. This helps in aligning their focus and mindset towards achieving their goal.

### Select Moods
Offers a list of moods categorized under various themes such as personal development, efficiency and execution, and interpersonal relationships. Users can select moods that resonate with their current task or goal.

## Why Use Configuration for Moods?
The mood selection is configured via a preference setting to ensure that the tags used for selecting projects are both meaningful and concise. This deliberate choice helps to minimize cognitive load and decision fatigue, making the process of selecting moods intentional and reflective, rather than arbitrary.
