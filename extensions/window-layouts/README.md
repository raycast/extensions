# Window Layouts

### Requires Raycast PRO

This extension takes X amount of open windows and tiles them into a chosen layout. Affected amount of windows depends on each individual layout.

You can choose a gap in extension settings that is applied between and around the windows.

> **NOTE!** This extension is **NOT** an automatic tiling window manager. Layout is only applied when the command is run from Raycast. At least one window must have focus when running a command.
