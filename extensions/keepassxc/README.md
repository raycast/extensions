<h1 align="center">KeePassXC for Raycast</h1>

<b align="center">Search your passwords, usernames, TOTP codes, and more using KeePassXC directly from Raycast.</b>

## Requirements
To use this extension, you will need:

- [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org).

## Security Note
Your credentials required to access your KeePass database, which include a password and an optional key file, are securely stored in [Raycast's local encrypted database](https://developers.raycast.com/information/security#data-storage). This storage prevents other extensions from accessing the storage of that extension.
