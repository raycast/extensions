## üóíÔ∏è NOTE

You can specify in Preferences if your data is stored in `EU` to use the `EU` API. However, Typeform does not inform if you have selected the correct API or not - it still returns data just "empty". So for example if you have responses in your form but the extension shows you have ZERO responses, you may have selected the wrong endpoint.
