- Added quicklook to see command details directly from the list. This can be toggled on or off as needed.
- Improved readability: aliases are now displayed as main text.
- A small dot icon is now displayed with the color of the type. You can deactivate it in preferences if you prefer everything more detached.
- We have changed `Favorite` to `Pin`, which is more intuitive and according to shortcuts `Cmd + Shift + P`.
