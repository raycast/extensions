# Visual Studio Code

Trigger Commands from Visual Studio Code.

## Requirements
You need to install Raycast for VSCode first. You can find it [here](vscode:extension/tonka3000.raycast)

## Limitations
VSCode does not provide aliases for all it's commands and therefore some commands are shown via ID and not it's internal alias.
