## Custom Commands

You can create custom PromptLab commands, accessed via the "Search PromptLab Commands" command, to execute your own prompts acting on the contents of selected files. The extension comes with 50+ useful custom commands preloaded, which you delete if desired.

### Placeholders

When creating custom commands, you can use placeholders in your prompts that will be substituted with relevant information whenever you run the command. These placeholders range from simple information, like the current date, to complex data retrieval operations such as getting the content of the most recent email. Placeholders are a powerful way to add context to your PromptLab prompts. The valid placeholders are as follows:

#### Script Placeholders

You can include AppleScript in your commands that will be run prior to sending the prompt to Raycast AI. The output of the script will be included in the final prompt. To do this, surround your script with three curly braces, {{{like this}}}. For example: 'Summarize this text: {{{tell application "TextEdit" to get text of document 1}}}'

#### URL Placeholders

You can instruct PromptLab to extract text from any webpage by using the {{URL}} placeholder. For example, `{{http://68k.news}}` would be replaced with the visible text of the 68k News homepage. You can use this to interface between files, data, webpages, and APIs.

Several convenient handlers for working with the response text are also provided, as listed below. Action Scripts can be used to build complex workflows using AI as a content provider, navigator, or decision-maker.
