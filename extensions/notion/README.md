# Notion

The fastest way to search and create Notion pages.

## Troubleshooting

### I cannot find the Notion page or database from Raycast

For new **root** pages in Notion you need to give Raycast Extenstion connection access to it.

- Open `Settings & members` menu in the top left corner.
- In `My connections` section (1) click the 3 dots next to the Raycast Extension (2) and hover over `Access selected pages` menu item (3).

- Make sure the missing page or database (or corresponding root page) is enabled.
- If not, you have to add the Raycast Extension connection to the required page (or root page) of your Notion. To add a connection, open required page and add a connection via the 3 dots menu in the top right corner `•••` (1), click on `+ Add connections` (2), search in the text field for `raycast` (3) and finally click on the `Raycast Extension` (4).
