# Example Usage of Protective Put Calculator

## Scenario 1: Conservative Earnings Play

**Setup:**
- Stock: OKLO (trading at $60)
- Expecting earnings announcement in 1 week
- Want to limit losses to $500 maximum
- Concerned about potential drop to $55

**Input:**
- Ticker: OKLO
- Stop Loss: $55.00
- Max Loss: $500
- Holding Period: 1 week

**Calculated Result:**
- Buy 75 shares at $60 = $4,500
- Buy 1 put contract (strike $55) = $300
- Total investment: $4,800
- Maximum loss: $675 (includes premium)
- Breakeven: $64.00

## Scenario 2: Larger Position

**Setup:**
- Stock: AAPL (trading at $180)
- Earnings in 2 weeks
- Maximum loss tolerance: $1,000
- Protection level: $170

**Input:**
- Ticker: AAPL
- Stop Loss: $170.00
- Max Loss: $1,000
- Holding Period: 2 weeks

**Calculated Result:**
- Buy 80 shares at $180 = $14,400
- Buy 1 put contract (strike $170) = $800
- Total investment: $15,200
- Maximum loss: $1,600 (includes premium)
- Breakeven: $190.00

## Key Benefits

1. **Loss Limitation**: Guarantees maximum downside regardless of how far stock falls
2. **Upside Participation**: Full profit potential above breakeven price
3. **Time-bound Protection**: Specific expiration date for defined risk period
4. **Liquidity**: Can close position early if needed

## Risk Considerations

1. **Time Decay**: Options lose value as expiration approaches
2. **Breakeven Risk**: Stock must rise above purchase price + premium to profit
3. **Opportunity Cost**: Premium paid reduces overall returns
4. **Early Assignment**: Rare but possible with American-style options

## When to Use

✅ **Good for:**
- Earnings announcements
- FDA approvals
- Volatile periods
- Large positions you want to protect

❌ **Avoid when:**
- Expecting small, gradual moves
- Very short-term trades (< 3 days)
- Already highly diversified positions
- Tight capital constraints

## Alternative Strategies

- **Stop Loss Orders**: Free but may gap down
- **Collar Strategy**: Sell calls to fund puts
- **Covered Calls**: Generate income but cap upside
- **Position Sizing**: Simply buy fewer shares
