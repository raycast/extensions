# Overview

Obsidian Smart Capture is a context aware tool to quickly capture anything on your Mac with minimal effort.

The notes are captured in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Obsidian is a community driven note taking application that stores notes locally on your machine in markdown format.

The quick capture tool is built using [Raycast](https://raycast.com). Raycast is a powerful MacOS launcher (similar to [MacOS spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlp1008/mac)). Raycast is also a community driven product like Obsidian.

I have combined two powerful community driven products to build an Open source tool that allows you to capture notes with ease.

_Obsidian smart capture was inspired by [Lazy](https://lazy.so)_

# Usage

### Context Awareness

Obsidian Smart Capture currently captures link of the active browser tab (Safari, Chrome, Arc, Brave, Firefox, Edge & Opera) and highlighted text if any.

Try selecting some text on Chrome and Safari and press `‚åò L` (or your custom hotkey) to open Obsidian Smart Capture. Press `‚åò ‚èé` to capture it

You aren't just limited to browser window, you can capture any selected text. Give it a try!

### Obsidian Settings

The popup will remember the vault and path you used to capture the last note and it will open with same settings every trigger

# Future

I originally built this for personal use but after positive response on Reddit, I open sourced and released it everyone to use

The goal is to add more context awareness to Obsidian Smart Capture and make the best quick capture tool for Obsidian.
