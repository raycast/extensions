# [Smart Obsidian Capture](https://lazyobsidian.typedream.app)


## Overview

Obsidian Smart Capture is a context aware tool to quickly capture anything on your Mac with minimal effort.

The notes are captured in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Obsidian is a community powered note application that stores notes locally on your machine in markdown format

The quick capture tool is built using [Raycast](https://raycast.com). Raycast is a powerful MacOS launcher (similar to [MacOS spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlp1008/mac)). However, Raycast is also community driven like Obsidian. 

I have combined two powerful community driven tools to build an Open source product that everyone can use to capture notes with ease.

*Obsidian smart capture was inspired by [Lazy](https://lazy.so)*

## How it works?

Obsidian Smart Capture captures link of the active browser tab (Safari and Chrome) and highlighted text if any.

### Obsidian Smart Capture Settings
The popup will remember the vault and path you used to capture the last note and it will open with same settings every trigger

## Future
I originally built this for personal use but after positive response on Reddit, I open sourced and released it for everyone.

The goal is to add more context awareness to Obsidian Smart Capture and make it the best quick capture tool for Obsidian. (similar to [Lazy](https://lazy.so))
