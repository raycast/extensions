[Real-Debrid](https://real-debrid.com) is a web service for downloading torrents remotely and unlocking some hoster links.

# Further development

Some ideas for further improvements:

- [ ] Change authentication method: The API token method is not recommended by RD because it can exposes potentially endpoints. None of these endpoints are used in this extension, but it's by far the easiest method to authenticate.
- [ ] `.torrent` file upload support: Personally, I prefer magnet links, but I realize this could be useful to some.
- [ ] Adding commands to add links and magnets via the clipboard or selected text.
- [ ] Maybe adding a torrent search functionality that ties in nicely with the existing features. I like the idea of a complete workflow through Raycast.
