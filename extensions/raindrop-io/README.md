## Instructions

### API Access Token

For this extension we need a test access token, for this you need to create an app in Raindrop's [settings](https://app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations).

1. In the **For Developers** section click on **+ Create new app**.
2. Set the app **name**, accept the Terms and Guidelines and click **Create**.
3. Click in the newly created app.
4. In the bottom of the form click on **Create test token**.
5. Copy the created token.

Install the extension and the first time you run any command it will ask you for your new token.

### Browser Extension (Recommended)

For enhanced functionality when capturing URLs and titles, we recommend installing the [Raycast Browser Extension](https://www.raycast.com/browser-extension). This extension provides better integration with your browser for a smoother experience.
