[â¬‡ Download Latest Release](https://github.com/insidegui/AssetCatalogTinkerer/raw/main/releases/AssetCatalogTinkerer_latest.zip)

You can also install it with Homebrew by running `brew install asset-catalog-tinkerer`!

## Unsupported Asset Types

Asset Catalog Tinkerer was designed with images in mind, so it doesn't support some of the more modern asset catalog features, such as PDFs, SVGs, or colors. It may or may not be updated in the future to support those.
