# Mochi

**This extension is not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Mochi Cards, LLC.**

Bring [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/) to Raycast so that you can create your card easily. No more context-switching!

## 🚀 Getting started

Before using the command, you need to retrieve your Mochi token located in the Account settings under the section called **API Keys**.

Then, copy it and paste it either into the extension's Welcome screen or in the extension's preferences under **API Key**.

## 🚸 Limitations

- To speed up startup, cache the deck information in LocalStorage. If template changes are not reflected, clear the cache with the cache clear command.
- File and image attachments are not supported.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [ ] Add a card search command
