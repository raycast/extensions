# WhenToMeet for Raycast

Create [WhenToMeet](https://whentomeet.io) scheduling events using natural language. This Raycast extension allows you to describe your event in plain English and instantly generates a pre-filled WhenToMeet URL with time slots, titles, and descriptions.

**Why Use This Extension:**
Instead of manually creating WhenToMeet events through the web interface, this Raycast extension streamlines the process by using AI to parse your natural language description and automatically generate a pre-filled WhenToMeet event URL. This saves time and reduces the friction of setting up scheduling polls.

## Features

- ‚è∞ **Time Slot Generation**: Automatically creates time slots and other metadata based on your description
- üîó **Instant URL Generation**: Opens WhenToMeet with pre-filled event details

## Usage

1. Open Raycast and search for "Create WhenToMeet Event"

   - "Football in the park next Friday 6pm to 8pm"
   - "Project kickoff Monday 9am, 10am, and 2pm for 90 minutes"
3. Review the parsed information (title, description, time slots, duration)
4. Edit any fields as needed
5. Click "Create WhenToMeet Event" to open the pre-filled URL

2. Converts relative dates and times to specific timestamps
3. Generates multiple time slot options based on your input
4. Creates a properly formatted WhenToMeet URL with all parameters
5. Opens the pre-filled event creation page in your browser
