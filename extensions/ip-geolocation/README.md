**IP Geolocation** Query Service from [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com). The following notes are from the official website

**Do I need an API key for the free endpoint?**

> We will never require an API key or registration and the API schema will not change.

**How many requests can I do?**

> Our endpoints are limited to 45 HTTP requests per minute from an IP address. If you go over this limit your requests will be throttled (HTTP 429) until your rate limit window is reset.
> If you need unlimited queries, please see our [pro service](https://members.ip-api.com/).
