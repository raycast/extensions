## üóíÔ∏è NOTES

- As of `Initial Version` you can get GPU Estimates and Coins. More commands will follow in the future.
- As the Free Plan has a limit of `100` API Calls per month, the extension tries to cache results as much as possible i.e.

    - `Coins` will be shown from the Cache (you can see the "last_updated" to know how old the cache is) but you can easily `Refresh` through the Action.
    - `GPU Estimates` will show from the Cache IF you enter the same "Power Cost" as sbefore
