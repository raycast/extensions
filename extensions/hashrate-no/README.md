## üóíÔ∏è NOTES

- Using `namesilo.com` as a query/parameter will almost always show an error e.g. running a `whois` for "namesilo.com" will error out. This is an issue with the API.
- You can email the NameSilo team to get access to a Sandbox / OTE environment but the extension does not currently support OTE (this might change in the future).
