# Placeholders for Raycast Pins

## Overview

Pins supports various placeholders that are evaluated at runtime whenever you open/execute a pin. These placeholders are useful for pinning items that rely on the current context such as selected text. The placeholders system is provided as a way to supply additional functionality for users that need or want it without complicating the core functionality of Pins.

Placeholders in Pins fall into three categories: **information placeholders**, which are replaced with information about the current context, **script placeholders**, which are replaced with the return value of some script, and **directives**, which are commands for Pins to execute that are generally replaced with an empty string (with some exceptions). You can think of information placeholders as a way to get an instantaneous snapshot of the current context, without performing any additional actions, while script placeholders can be used to perform actions and process data before resolving to a string value.

All placeholders are evaluated at runtime — when you open/execute a pin — and are replaced in order of precedence, with script placeholders generally evaluated last. Thus, you can use information placeholders in your scripts to make them even more dynamic. See [Placeholder Precedence](#placeholder-precedence) for more information on how placeholders are evaluated.

### Why would I use placeholders?

Placeholders allow pins to be more dynamic and context-aware. You can use placeholders to pin common _workflows_ rather than static items. For example, you can create a pin that saves the current webpage to a specific folder in Finder, or a pin that uploads selected text to GitHub Gist.

> **Note**
> Placeholders are case-sensitive unless otherwise noted.

## Placeholder Precedence

Placeholders are evaluated in order of precedence, rather than in the order they appear in a prompt. Precedence has been decided based on several factors, including how fast a placeholder executes, how often it is likely to be used, how likely it is to be used in combination with other placeholders, etc. As such, there are no concrete rules for placeholder precedence, but the following general guidelines apply:

- Placeholders that execute quickly are given higher precedence than those that execute slowly.
- Directives that don't accept content are given higher precedence than other placeholders.
- Directives that accept content are given lower precedence than other placeholders.
- Information placeholders are given higher precedence than script placeholders.
- Placeholders more likely to be used are given higher precedence than those less likely to be used.
- Placeholders that are likely to be used in combination with other placeholders as their contents are given lower precedence than those that are not.
- The `{{js:...}}` placeholder is given the lowest precedence of all script placeholders.
- The order of precedence for extension placeholders such as `{{csv:...:...}}` is determined first by their category (e.g. text files, images, videos, audio, PDFs, in that order), then alphabetically.
- Custom placeholders are given the highest precedence of all placeholders.

> **Note**
> Higher precedence means earlier evaluation.

The precedence order of individual placeholders can be difficult to conceptualize and predict; the best to find out is to try it out yourself. Here are some examples of how precedence works in practice:

- The order of most information placeholders, e.g. `{{currentDirectory}}`, `{{user}}`, `{{time}}`, etc., does not generally matter, as they either do not accept content or parameters, or it is unlikely that you'll want to use the output of another placeholder as input to them.
- `{{todayReminders}}` has higher precedence than `{{yearReminders}}` because it executes faster and is more likely to be used.
- `{{get [name]}}` has higher precedence than most other placeholders because it is unlikely that you will want to use it in combination with other placeholders, and it executes quickly.
- `{{set [name]:...}}` has lower precedence than most other placeholders because it is likely that you will want to use the output of another placeholder as input to it.
- `{{csv:...:...}}` has higher precedence than `{{jsx:...:...}}` because it occurs earlier in the alphabet.
- `{{csv:...:...}}` has higher precedence than `{{avi:...:...}}` because text files have higher precedence than videos, as they are more likely to be used.
- `{{csv:...:...}}` has higher precedence than `{{as:...}}` because it is more likely that you'd want to conditionally execute AppleScript code rather than conditionally include a script's output.
- `{{as:...}}` and `{{jxa:...}}` have higher precedence than `{{shell:...}}` because it is easier to use AppleScript and JXA to execute shell commands than the other way around.
- `{{url:...}}` has higher precedence than `{{prompt:...}}` or `{{shortcut:...}}` because it is more likely that you will want to use the contents of a URL in a prompt/as shortcut input than the other way around.
- `{{ignore:...}}` has lower precedence than `{{js:...}}` because it is more likely that you will want to use the output of a JavaScript placeholder as input to `{{ignore:...}}` than the other way around, and you can call the `ignore(content)` function in JavaScript to achieve the same result.

> **Note**
> Precedence is **not** guaranteed to remain the same in future versions of Pins. The guidelines above are _likely_ to remain true, but even that is not guaranteed. Any changes to precedence will be documented in the release notes.

## JavaScript Placeholder Reference

The `{{js:...}}` placeholder allows you to execute sandboxed JavaScript code and use the return value in your pin. The code is executed in a sandboxed environment that provides read-only access to various information about the current context. All placeholders except `{{js:...}}` are available to the JavaScript code as global functions. For example, you can use `{{js:currentAppName()}}` to get the name of the frontmost application. You can combine placeholders to create more complex JavaScript code, as in the code below.

```javascript
osascript -e 'set cApp to "{{currentAppName}}"
tell application "Notes"
    set newNote to make new note with properties {body: "{{js:
        // Get the name of most played song using JavaScript for Automation
        jxa(`(() => {
                const music = Application("Music")
                const frequentPlaylist = music.playlists["Top 25 Most Played"]
                const tracks = frequentPlaylist.tracks()
                const mostPlayedTrack = tracks[1]
                return mostPlayedTrack.name()
            })()`)

        // Get the artist of the most played song using AppleScript
        .then((favSong) => 
            as(`tell application "Music"
                    activate
                    play track "${favSong.trim()}"
                    delay 1
                    set theArtist to artist of current track
                    stop
                    return theArtist
                end tell`)

        // Search Google for songs by the artist
        .then((theArtist) => url(`https://google.com/search?q=Songs%20by%20${theArtist}`)
            .then((text) => {
                // Format the text to be displayed in the note
                const dateStr = `{{date format="MMMM d, yyyy"}}`
                const visibleText = text.replaceAll("'", "'\\''").replaceAll('"', "\\\"").replaceAll("\n", "<br /><br />")
                return `${dateStr}<br /><br />${visibleText}`
            })
        ))}}"}
    show newNote
end tell
delay 1
tell application cApp to activate'
```

This code, which can be set as a Pin target, interweaves several placeholders to look up the artist of the currently playing song in Music, search Google for songs by that artist, and create a new note in Notes with the search results as the body. This particular example is a bit contrived, but it demonstrates the power of the `{{js:...}}` placeholder.
