# Quick Notes

Create simple markdown notes in Raycast stored locally. No integrations required!

### Features

- View, create, and delete markdown notes
- Search by note title, body, or tag
- Draft and auto-save if you accidentally exit out while creating/editing a new note
- Export notes to a folder to use in another application
- Setup auto-save to a folder of your choice, set in preferences

If you‚Äôd like, you can export or auto-sync your notes as markdown to a directory to use in a 3rd-party app like Obisidian, VS Code, or Notion. This is completely optional though and notes will still save locally.
