# Tidal Controller Changelog

## [Initial Version] - 2024-08-19

This is the first version of the Tidal Controller extension. This release includes only a few simple commands to control Tidal with:

- Play current track
- Pause current track
- Toggle Play/Pause of current track
- Toggle shuffle mode
- Play next track
- Restart or play previous track

I have plans to expand this extension in the future to control more of Tidal's features. Tidal's app, sdk, and api are all fairly limited still so I'll be bugging the Tidal team to expand them.
