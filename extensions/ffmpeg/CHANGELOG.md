# FFmpeg Changelog

## [Added conversion option and percentage progress] - 2023-10-17

- I added a new video file conversion option, called VideoLoop Converter. This uses FFMPEG to create a h.264 .mp4 file without sound, at a bitrate of 4000kbps. This is intended to be used as a replacement for GIFs on certain websites.
- Changed the progress view so that the feedback is in percentage, rather than a float between 0 and 1.
- Fixed an issue that prevented processing (rotation/conversion) of files that has spaces in the path.
- Changed version number to 1.1.0, from 1.0.0
