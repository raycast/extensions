## Getting Started

This extension brings GitHub Enterprise support to Raycast through the use of GraphQL and personal access tokens. To get started, first:

- Login to your organization's GitHub instance (Eg. https://github.mycompany.com)
- Click on your avatar image in the right upper corner
- From the dropdown menu, click on `Settings`
- On the left-hand side, click on `Developer settings`.
- On the left-hand side, click on `Personal access tokens`.
- On this page, we'll create a new access token. Click on `Generate new token` in the upper-right.
- Leave a `note` for your token (Eg. `Raycast`). This will help you identify it in the future.
- You'll need to check the following boxes to ensure this extension can perform properly:
    - `repo`
    - `user`
    - `write:discussion`
- Click `Generate token` and save this value somewhere. **You'll only be able to see this once**.

> Future updates to this extension will offer more functionality that may require additional scopes be defined in this token.

## Configuring the Extension

Launch the GitHub for Enterprise Raycast extension. You can select any command to get started.

When launching a command, you'll be presented with a configuration screen asking for three pieces of information: 

- `GraphQL API` (Eg. https://github.mycompany.com/api/graphql)
- `Username`
- `Token`

![Configuration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6590356/140934002-081ed77e-6fe2-4b5a-aadc-feb662db6407.png)

Once this information has been filled in, you should have access to manage your issues and pull requests.
