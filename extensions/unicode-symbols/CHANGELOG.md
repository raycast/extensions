# Unicode Symbols

## [Improvements] - 2024-12-17

- Added option to set Primary Action (`copy`/`paste`) - ([#15901](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/15901))
- Updated (dev) dependencies

## [Improvements] - 2024-10-11

- Updated the paste action to dynamically show the name and icon of the frontmost application.

## [Improvements] - 2024-09-30

- Added full dataset with option in settings to enable/disable. Full Dataset contains +40.000 characters. This is only supported in Grid view.
- Added option to copy the optional `HTML` entity of the selected character (e.g. `&amp;`)
- Added a browser view for the character in [compart](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/)
- Made the JSON files smaller by renaming the fields. This does break the cache, so the cache key is renamed to `recently-used-v2`

- Added extra characters to Superscript and Subscript set ([#14533](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/14533))
  - This is purely a visual thing, doesn't change the actual character sets
  - Also added an indicator to show that this character is actually in a different set

- Updated to `unidata16`, which uses the latest `16.0.0` Unicode data
