# Minesweeper

Play minesweeper right in Raycast!

This is highly experimental, so please forward any bug reports to this [link](https://github.com/gfdsyjkdyhkfsydkh/minesweeper-raycast/issues/new).

## Functionality
It has all of classic minesweeper functionality. 

To open a square, you either press enter or double click it, and to flag, you press CMD plus enter.<BR>
If you try to open an already opened square, it will open all the neighbouring squares.
