# Positron for Raycast

Got the idea while reading this [post](https://bsky.app/profile/andrew.heiss.phd/post/3lukm4lrugc2k). This extension is practically a copy of the VSCode extension for Raycast. Same idea and same usage. So, kudos to the team that built said extension.

## Commands

- **List Recent Projects** - View and open your recent Positron projects
- **Open with Positron** - Open Finder selections in Positron (requires Finder/Path Finder to be active)
- **Open New Window** - Launch a new Positron window

## Requirements

- macOS
- [Positron IDE](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) installed
- Raycast

## Installation

Install from the Raycast Store or build from source.
