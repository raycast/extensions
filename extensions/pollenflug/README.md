# Pollenflug

A simple raycast extension fetching pollen data from the DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst) public API â€“ initially made for personal use ðŸ¤§ðŸŒ±.

Pin allergens relevant for you, and choose from the regions provided by DWD. Using `âŒ˜+1`, `âŒ˜+2` and `âŒ˜+3` you can cycle through today, tomorrow and the day after.

Feel free to contribute if you'd like to, I'll improve on some things later on. If it is polished I might submit it to the store as well.

Stay healthy!
