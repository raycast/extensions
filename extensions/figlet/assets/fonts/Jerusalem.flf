Modified for figlet 2.1 by Glenn Chappell 16 Dec 1993
Date: 13 Feb 1994

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
7    - height of a character
6    - height of a character, not including descenders
100  -  max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font
31   - number of comment lines
1    - print right-to-left (figlet 2.1 or later only)

Hebrew keyboard maps:

All capital letters print the english character for that key.  All numbers 
and symbols are the same in in Hebrew/English except for those shown here.
The * symbol prints as a Jewish star (Star of David).
