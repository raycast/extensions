Cricket by Leslie Bates        Jan. 1, 1996

I wish to thank Wade Fincher for the SIG that was used as a base for Cricket as
well as Chris Gill who designed the Square font, some of which was used in 
Cricket. And finally I wish to thank Paul Burton, who if it was not for his 
desire to create FIGWin, I may never have had the motivation to create a 
FIGfont.
 FIGWin is the Windows clone of FIGlet with a full featured FIGfont editor!
 Forget about doing the math to figure out the smushmode number.  Just check a
 few boxes for each smushing rule.  Forget about endmarks -- let the computer
 figure out how tall and how wide your font is.  Just draw FIGfonts with the
 mouse and wipe the smudgemarks off your screen from all that counting!

 FIGWin is full of features, but it's designed for use by a complete idiot.  If
 you qualify, visit the FIGWin website.  Screen shots are shown, and of course
 you can download it.  (FREE!)

This was to widen the space character.
