Avatar by Claude Martins 02/95

Figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
10    - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
16   - default smushmode for this font
16   - number of comment lines
