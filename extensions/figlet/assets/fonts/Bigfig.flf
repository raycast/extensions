flf2a$ 3 3 5 -1 23
Expansion font for bigfig program by Glenn Chappell 4/93 -- based on Mini
26 Apr 1995
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

This font is intended to be used with the "bigfig" program. It can
be used as an ordinary figlet font, but it won't look very nice.
"bigfig" is available by anonymous ftp from "ftp.nicoh.com". Look in
the directory "pub/figlet/util".

Or, if you'd rather not use the bigfig program, just type
figlet -w27 -f myfavoritefont | figlet -f bigfig

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be `a', for now

3    - height of a character
3    - height of a character, not including descenders
5    - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font
23   - number of comment lines
