flf2a$ 10 10 99 -1 12
The purpose of this figlet font is to produce fingering charts,
called tablature, for six hole diatonic flutes such as the tin
whistle. It is a marriage of figlet with abc, a text-based music
notation system. There are 5-10 thousand abc songs online. Check
out Chris Walshaw's abc home page at
http://www.gre.ac.uk/~c.walshaw/abc/ to learn all about it.

This font is for flutes tuned in D playing songs in D major or
related modes. Other fonts are available for other keys.

To produce tab simply choose an abc song and print it out with this
font. See http://www.cyberspace.org/~jh/tab/ for more information.
