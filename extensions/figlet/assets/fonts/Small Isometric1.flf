Downsized version of isometric1.flf - M. Lindsey (mglindse@nyx.cs.du.edu)
February 24, 1996

isometric1.flf

Figlet conversion by Kent Nassen (kentn@cyberspace.org), 8-10-94, based
on the fonts posted by Lennert Stock:

From: stock@fwi.uva.nl (Lennert Stock)
Date: 15 Jul 1994 00:04:25 GMT

Here are some fonts. Non-figlet I'm afraid, if you wanna convert them, be
my guest. I posted the isometric fonts before.
