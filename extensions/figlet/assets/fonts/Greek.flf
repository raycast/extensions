NTGreek by Bruce Jakeway--based on Standard by Glenn Chappell & Ian Chai
Questions and comments regarding ntgreek.flf to pbjakeway@neumann.uwaterloo.ca
For figlet release 2.0
Date:  1994 Apr 2

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
9    - height of a character
7    - height of a character, not including descenders
13   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
30   - number of comment lines
