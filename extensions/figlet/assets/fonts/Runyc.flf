flf2a$ 6 6 15 -1 20
The elder futhark  -- by Bryan Alexander <alexande@mathcs.rhodes.edu>
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
This font consists of the runes in the elder futhark.  It is accurate as
far as I know.  Any corrections, or ideas on improving the font's appearance
are welcome.  Modifying this font is fine with me; please e-mail me the
result.

3 point version of the runes used as uppercase added as lowercase letters
