decimal.flf by Karlton Wirsing based on
binary.flf (C) 1994 by Victor Parada (vparada@inf.utfsm.cl) 94/12/05

figlet 2.1 font, includes ISO Latin-1, excludes "-D" option chars.

Spaces are not shown as binary.  If this is required, change "$@" below
to " @".  Change to "@" to remove the hardspace between words.
Note that figlet always removes spaces when it moves words to a new line.

Try option "-m 0" to remove the space between letters (octets).
