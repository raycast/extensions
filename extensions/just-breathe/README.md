An extension for relaxation through breathing

Various methods and practices exist to induce profound relaxation through breathing. By pausing your breath, you enhance oxygenation within your body. If you've had a challenging day, square breathing is a great way to focus. Multitasking and busy schedules can be exhausting for the brain and leave you feeling foggy and unfocused.

**Taking a Break**

It's important to take a short break and clear your head before returning to your regular tasks. A visual aid isn't necessary, but it can provide a point of focus while you learn this new breathing technique.

**Here's how it works:**

1. Breathe in for a count of 4, visualizing one side of a square.
2. Hold your breath for a count of 4, visualizing the second side of the square.
3. Breathe out for a count of 4, visualizing the third side.
4. Fourth side - Hold your breath again for a count of 4, completing the square.

Such cycles should be repeated for 1-3 minutes, but preferably 4-5 minutes. This technique is designed to help you relax after a long day, or before/after a challenging task or conversation.

On a personal note, I've found the [Calmaria](https://calmaria.app/) app incredibly useful before bedtime. It has a wonderful interface and animations, and it truly helps me relax. Give it a try and see if it works for you too!
