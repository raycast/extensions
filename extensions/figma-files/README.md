## Setup

Currently, this extension only works with team accounts. To local your team ID, visit Figma.com and click the team name you wish to use. In the URL copy the ID that comes BETWEEN the word `/team/` and BEFORE your actual team name.

> Example https://www.figma.com/files/team/12345678987654321/NameOfTeam...

You'll also need a Personal Access Token. To create this, click on your avatar on Figma.com and go to settings. Scroll down to Personal Access Token and create a new one to use with Raycast.

Paste both of these into the Raycast preferences for this extension.
