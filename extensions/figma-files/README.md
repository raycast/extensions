## Setup

Currently, this extension only works with team accounts. Drafts are not supported due to a Figma API limitation. To locate your team ID, visit Figma.com and click the team name you wish to use. In the URL, copy the ID that comes BETWEEN the word `/team/` and BEFORE your actual team name.

> Example https://www.figma.com/files/team/12345678987654321/NameOfTeam...

You'll also need a Personal Access Token. To create this, click on your avatar on Figma.com and go to settings. Scroll down to Personal Access Token and create a new one to use with Raycast.

Paste both of these into the Raycast preferences for this extension.
