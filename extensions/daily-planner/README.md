# Daily Planner

Daily Planner is a [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) extension designed to help you take control of your time and optimize your productivity. Time block your day, track time spent on tasks, and analyze your time usage—all from the convenience of your macOS launcher. Stay focused and on track with a running timer and task title displayed in the menu bar.

## 🌟 Features

- **Block Time for To-Dos**: Schedule focus time blocks for tasks from your favorite to-do list apps like Reminders, Things, or Todoist.
- **Track Time for To-Dos**: Track time spent on tasks using Toggl or Clockify, or directly on your calendar. Compare actual time spent with the time blocks you've budgeted for each task.
- **Generate Productivity Reports**: Build customizable reports on blocked and tracked time to uncover productivity patterns and optimize your workflow. Discover how much time you're spending on meetings and other events.
- **Show Menu Bar Timer**: Stay focused with a running timer and associated task title displayed in the macOS Menu.
- **Split Screen To-Dos and Calendar**: Arrange your primary to-do app (Reminders, Things, or Todoist) and macOS Calendar app side by side for a convenient view of your daily tasks and scheduled events. Relaunch the command to restore the to-do app and Calendar window positions and sizes to their original state.

## 🚀 Advantages

- **Seamless To-Do List App Integration**: Continue using your favorite to-do list apps like **Reminders**, **Things**, and **Todoist**—no need to migrate data or learn new systems.
- **Local Calendar Integration**: Your calendar is access locally and securely using macOS frameworks, keeping your data safe without sending it to the cloud.
- **Flexible Time Tracking Options**: Choose from a range of time tracking options, such as using your calendar for a fully-offline, privacy-first experience, or integrating with a popular app like Toggl or Clockify. Or, simply skip time tracking if it's not your thing.
- **Effortless Free Time Finder**: Daily Planner quickly locates available times in your schedule based on natural language input, helping you to rapidly schedule and reschedule time blocks without sifting through calendar events.
- **Natural Language Date Interval Input**: Schedule your time blocks using concise natural language phrases such as “1h”, “2-3p”, or “90 minutes early next week”. Use natural language for report generation as well, like “last 5 weeks” or “late afternoon”.
- **Offline-first and Privacy-focused**: Opt for apps that don't rely on network APIs—Reminders, Things, and Calendar—for complete offline functionality and data processing on your device.
- **Efficient Keyboard Navigation**: Time block your day with just a few keystrokes, eliminating the need to manually copy and paste data.

## 🎯 Getting Started

1. Download [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) if you haven’t already.
2. Install [Daily Planner Extension](https://www.raycast.com/benyn/daily-planner).
3. When you launch any of the five commands, you’ll be asked to choose your primary to-do list app and the calendar to use for time blocking. Enter an existing calendar name if you already have a calendar you can use for time blocking. If not, you’ll see a prompt that lets you create a calendar with the name you entered.
4. If you wish to use time tracking, you'll need to provide a few more details. When you launch the "Track Time for To-Dos" command for the first time, you'll be prompted to enter these data points in the Raycast Extension Settings. Start by selecting your preferred method (Calendar, Toggl, or Clockify). If you choose Calendar, enter the name of the calendar for time tracking, ideally different from the one used for Time Blocking Calendar. If you opt for Toggl or Clockify, input the corresponding API key.
5. Time block your day, track time, review your productivity, and repeat!
