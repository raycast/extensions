# PyCharm Recent Projects Raycast extension

This extension is inspired by the "JetBrains Toolbox Recent Projects" extension. 
I liked the idea, but I use a standalone installation of PyCharm so came up with this simple extension.
Please bear in mind I'm a Python developer myself and have little to no experience in JS/TypeScript so please do not expect any extensive support for this extension.
If you would like to contribute, PRs are welcome of course.

The extension gives a list of recent projects in PyCharm, ordered by last access time. It allows to quickly open a project or delete one from the list. 
No special configuration is required, but I personally prefer to set `py` alias to the command.
