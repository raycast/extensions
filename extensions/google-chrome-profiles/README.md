    View your Google Chrome profiles, show bookmarks, open the right profile.

## Why

Profiles in Chrome are absolutely awesome. It allows to keep your browsing experience (bookmarks, navigation history, passwords, and other settings) separated by company / perso / pro / whatever.

Problem: jumping from a profile to another is painful.

Here comes this extension:

Hit `âŒ˜ â‡§ M`, choose the right profile, hit `Enter â†µ`, and tada ðŸŽ‰

## How it works

When the extension opens, it lists all your existing profiles.

> Hit `Enter â†µ` to enter a profile's bookmarks, or `âŒ˜ â†µ` to open (or focus) the profile chrome window.

When entering a profile, you can choose whether:

- open a new blank tab
- filter the bookmarks and/or open a bookmark
- search the input text in the search engine of your choice (cf. settings)
- open the URL in the clipboard (if any of course) in a new tab

> Hit `Enter â†µ` to open the selected item and close the Raycast main window, or `âŒ˜ â†µ` to open the selected item and keep Raycast opened.

## Hotkey (recommended)

I highly recommend that you map the default Google Chrome profile shortcut (`âŒ˜ â‡§ M`) to open this extension. Like so:

## Settings

If needed, set the URL for the new tab (default is `about:blank`) and your search engine in the extension setting (default is `google.com`).
