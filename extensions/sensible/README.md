## Usage
You're required to enter a `Document type` when extracting from Sensible. Think of this as a bucket of configurations. Each configuration may be used to extract data from a document with a slightly different layout. Each document type has an associated endpoint which is used to extract data from your document.

To create a new `Document type`, visit [https://app.sensible.so/document-types](https://app.sensible.so/document-types) and click `New document type`. You'll be prompted to enter a name. Once you've created a document type, it will show up here in Raycast. However, you'll need to create at least one configuration before you can extract data from a document.
