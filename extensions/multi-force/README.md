# MultiForce

MultiForce is a Raycast extension that lets you save all of your Salesforce environments and quickly log in. This is the ultimate tool for developers and Salesforce admins who work in multiple Salesforce environments, solving business problems with clicks, code, and curiosity. 

MultiForce makes it easy to log in to orgs through a simple interface for adding, organizing, and removing Salesforce environments that you use day to day. Once added, you can add labels, colored icons, and group similar accounts into sections to quickly find the org you want to open in your browser.

## Synchronize Your Salesforce Development Environment

Thanks to the Salesforce/Core library, MultiForce works on the same keystore as the SF CLI tool and the Salesforce VS Code Development Package! Adding an org in MultiForce automatically adds the org everywhere else! Did you authenticate a new org from VS Code? MultiForce will ask if you want to bring that org into your list!


## Actions

Each org on the list comes with built in actions that you can take! 

| Shortcut    | Action |
| -------- | ------- |
| Enter  | Open the selected org in your browser and navigate to your default path. |
| ⌘ Enter  | Edit the selected org. |
| ⌘ H | Open the selected org in your browser and navigate to the Lightning Home.  |
| ⌘ S | Open the selected org in your browser and navigate to the Salesforce Setup Home.  |
| ⌘ N | Add a new Salesforce Org to your list. |
| ⌃ X | Delete the selected org from your list. (Note, this will also remove it as an org from the SF command and VSCode).     |
