## Getting started

Before using the command, you need to retrieve your Zotero API and user ID. This can be easily done
by following [this guide](https://stavanger.instructure.com/courses/6342/pages/finding-zotero-user-id-and-zotero-api-key).

## Features

This extension supports both quick search and tags. `tags` should be prefixed with `.`! Lets consider
this example: "machine learning .python .ML resnet" -> This will search for "machine learning resnet"
with tags of python OR resnet.

Please not that currently only OR operation is supported for the tags.

Please see this guide for additional details about the query patterns.
