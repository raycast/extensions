> Yet Another FFMPEG Wrapper.

Compress videos easily from [Raycast](https://raycast.com). Zero config. From your clipboard, or the Finder.

## Requirements

It *obviously* requires ffmpeg, but it does not come bundled with it. It will use the one from your system.

The easiest way to install ffmpeg is using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

If it's not installed on a standard path, you can specify the path to ffmpeg in the extension settings.
