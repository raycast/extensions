> Yet Another FFMPEG Wrapper.

Compress videos easily from [Raycast](https://raycast.com). Zero config. From your clipboard, or the Finder.

## Requirements

It *obviously* requires ffmpeg, but it does not come bundled with it. It will use the one from your system.

**If `ffmpeg` is in your $PATH, you can fill `ffmpeg` in the setting form box.**

The easiest way to install ffmpeg is using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

Then you can do `which ffmpeg` and paste that path in the extension settings.
