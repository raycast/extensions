# Common Programming Concepts

This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language and how they work in Cairo. Many programming languages have much in common at their core. None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Cairo, but we’ll discuss them in the context of Cairo and explain the conventions around using these concepts.

Specifically, you’ll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments, and control flow. These foundations will be in every Cairo program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.
