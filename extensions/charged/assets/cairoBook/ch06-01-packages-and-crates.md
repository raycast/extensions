# Packages and Crates

## What is a crate?
A crate is the smallest amount of code that the Cairo compiler considers at a time. Even if you run `cairo-compile` rather than `scarb build` and pass a single source code file, the compiler considers that file to be a crate. Crates can contain modules, and the modules may be defined in other files that get compiled with the crate, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.

## What is the crate root?
The crate root is the `lib.cairo` source file that the Cairo compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate (we’ll explain modules in depth in the [“Defining Modules to Control Scope”](./ch06-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope.md) section).

## What is a package?
A cairo package is a bundle of one or more crates with a Scarb.toml file that describes how to build those crates. This enables the splitting of code into smaller, reusable parts and facilitates more structured dependency management.

## Creating a Package with Scarb

You can create a new Cairo package using the scarb command-line tool. To create a new package, run the following command:

```bash
scarb new my_package
```

This command will generate a new package directory named `my_package` with the following structure:

```
my_package/
├── Scarb.toml
└── src
    └── lib.cairo
```

- `src/` is the main directory where all the Cairo source files for the package will be stored.
- `lib.cairo` is the default root module of the crate, which is also the main entry point of the package. By default, it is empty.
- `Scarb.toml` is the package manifest file, which contains metadata and configuration options for the package, such as dependencies, package name, version, and authors. You can find documentation about it on the [scarb reference](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/reference/manifest).

```toml
[package]
name = "my_package"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
# foo = { path = "vendor/foo" }
```

As you develop your package, you may want to organize your code into multiple Cairo source files. You can do this by creating additional `.cairo` files within the `src` directory or its subdirectories.
