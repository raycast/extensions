## Raycast overview

- What it is
    - Productivity & util stuff for mac
- How I access it
- What I can do with it
    - Launch apps
    - Run commands & scripts
    - App store, which integrates with the rest of your nac & its apps pretty well

## Examples
- `npm search`
- `kill` app
- `My Schedule`
- `toggle light/dark mode`
- `Quick reminder/timer/note`

## Hotkeys
- option + C for chatGPT
- option + V for clipboard history
- option + E for emoji picker
- option + G for GIF search

## What I'm making
- Extension that kills all open (GUI) apps
- Very quickly realised I had to create a feature to whitelist apps that the script should never close
- Initial creation & testing of this extension would be very annoying without the whitelist featureðŸ’€
