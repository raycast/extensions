# Raycast Developer Utilities

A collection of useful Raycast commands designed for developers.

## Commands

### Timestamp Converter

Easily convert between Unix timestamps (seconds or milliseconds) and human-readable date/time formats, with support for different timezones.

**Features:**

*   **Convert Timestamp to Date/Time:** Enter a 10-digit (seconds) or 13-digit (milliseconds) Unix timestamp to see the corresponding date and time.
*   **Convert Date/Time to Timestamp:** Use the date picker or manually input Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second (and optionally Millisecond) to get the corresponding Unix timestamp.
*   **Timezone Support:** Select a timezone (GMT, UTC+/- offsets) to view the date/time components in that specific zone. The underlying timestamp always remains UTC.
*   **Milliseconds Toggle:** Switch between using seconds or milliseconds for the timestamp value.
*   **Clipboard Detection:** Automatically detects and parses timestamps from your clipboard when the command is opened.
*   **Relative Time:** Shows the time relative to now (e.g., "5 minutes ago", "in 2 hours").

**Usage:**

1.  Open Raycast and type the command name (e.g., "Convert Timestamp").
2.  The current date/time and timestamp will be pre-filled.
3.  You can:
    *   Paste or type a Unix timestamp into the "Unix Timestamp" field.
    *   Use the "Date" picker to select a date.
    *   Manually edit the Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, or Millisecond fields.
    *   Change the "Timezone" dropdown.
4.  The other fields will update automatically.
5.  Press Enter to copy the current Unix timestamp to your clipboard.
6.  Use the Action Panel (`âŒ˜K`) to toggle between using seconds and milliseconds.
