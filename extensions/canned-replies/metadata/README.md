# Store Screenshots

Use Raycast's Window Capture to create consistent, crisp images and enable "Save to Metadata" so screenshots are saved in this folder with the correct names.

How to capture
- Open Raycast → Settings → Advanced → enable Window Capture.
- Run the extension in dev: `npm run dev`.
- For each screen below: open it, press the camera button in the top-right of the Raycast window, and toggle "Save to Metadata" (keeps images here).
- Use Light mode (default) and consider adding one Dark mode shot if it looks notably different.
- Keep the frame focused on Raycast (avoid other app windows). Crop is handled by Raycast.

Recommended shots
1) Main list with multiple templates visible and a search query (shows filtering).
2) Action Panel for a template focused on "Insert and Send" + "Insert Without Sending" (shows core speed action).
3) Create/Edit Template form (title + body fields).
4) Import from JSON form (file picker visible).
5) Export to JSON form (directory picker visible).

Tips
- Use clear, realistic template titles/bodies.
- Avoid sensitive or personal data in examples.
- Keep text readable: ensure enough items are visible without clutter.

After capturing
- Choose the strongest image as the cover during publish.
- Keep 3–6 total screenshots for a clean, focused gallery.
