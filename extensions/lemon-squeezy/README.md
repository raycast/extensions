# Lemon Squeezy

This is a Raycast extension for [Lemon Squeezy](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/) - _Payments, tax & subscriptions for software companies_.

With this extension you can:

- List all orders in all your stores
- List all products in all your stores

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install extension**: Click the `Install Extension` button in the top right of [this page](https://www.raycast.com/xmok/lemon-squeezy) OR `install` via Raycast Store

2. **Enter your Lemon Squeezy API Key**: The first time you use the extension, you'll need to enter Key in Preferences OR at first prompt:

    a. `Navigate` to [Settings > API](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/api)

    b. `Click` on **+**

    c. `Enter` "Name" (e.g. RYCST) and `Select` a reasonable **Expiration Date**

    d. `Click` **Create API key**

    e. `Copy` and `Paste` in Preferences

## üóíÔ∏è NOTES

1. At the moment, the extension shows data from _all_ your Stores. If you have a single store, this should not be a problem. In future updates we will try to incorporate filters, sections or figure out another efficient way of displaying data from different stores.

2. To toggle between **Live** and **Test** mode, simply enter the appropriate key in `Preferences`.
