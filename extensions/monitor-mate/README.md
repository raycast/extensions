# MonitorMate 🖥️

Hey there! Welcome to MonitorMate, your go-to buddy for keeping an eye on your system's or remote server's resources. It's simple, slick, and super handy. Let's dive in!

## Getting Started 🚀

First things first, you're going to need Raycast on your macOS device. Don't have it yet? No worries, grab it [here](https://www.raycast.com/). Once you're all set with Raycast, you can snag MonitorMate directly from the Raycast official store. A few clicks and voilà, you're in business!

## How to Use 🛠️

With MonitorMate, you're just a few steps away from having a full overview of your resources. Here’s how to get the ball rolling:

### Commands

- **Add Resource**: Want to keep tabs on a resource? Hit 'Add Resource', punch in the URL and port number, and you're golden. This works for both local and remote resources. 🌍
- **Show Dashboard**: Here's where the magic happens. Your dashboard is your mission control, showing you everything at a glance. Click on any resource to get the nitty-gritty details, complete with snazzy visual graphs. 📊
- **Check Resource**: This little ninja runs silently in the background, checking on your resources every minute. It keeps your dashboard fresh and up-to-date without you lifting a finger. ⏲️

### Notifications

- **Alerts**: When a resource takes a nosedive, MonitorMate has your back. You'll hear an alert sound 🔊 (don't worry, you can mute it if you want peace and quiet). Your dashboard will instantly update with the latest status.
