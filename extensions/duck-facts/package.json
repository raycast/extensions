These ducks are characterized by their compact bodies and short necks, making them a popular choice for ornamental purposes in backyard settings and exhibitions. One fascinating aspect of the White Call Duck is its unique ability to produce a variety of sounds, which are often described as \"quacks\" but are actually a series of high-pitched calls. This vocalization is not only a means of communication but also plays a role in social bonding and territory establishment among ducks. Additionally, the breed's genetic makeup has been selectively enhanced over generations, leading to their vibrant plumage and sociable nature, making them a delightful addition to any avian collection."

Their compact, streamlined bodies reduce drag, while specialized webbed feet act as powerful paddles, enabling them to dive to depths of up to 15 meters (50 feet) in search of aquatic vegetation and invertebrates. This adaptation not only enhances their foraging capabilities but also plays a crucial role in their survival in diverse aquatic habitats."

One interesting fact is that rubber ducks have been used in scientific studies to track ocean currents and pollution. In 1992, a shipping container filled with thousands of plastic bath toys, including rubber ducks, was accidentally released into the Pacific Ocean. These toys began to wash up on shores around the world, providing researchers with valuable data on oceanic drift patterns and the movement of marine debris. This phenomenon highlights the impact of human-made materials on marine ecosystems and underscores the importance of understanding ocean currents, which are influenced by factors such as wind patterns and the Earth's rotation."
