This is a Raycast extension for [Resend](https://resend.com/). With this extension, you can Manage API Keys and Domains, and Send Emails using Resend.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install extension**: Click the `Install Extension` button in the top right of [this page](https://www.raycast.com/xmok/resend)

2. **Get your API Key**: The first time you use the extension, you'll need to enter your Resend API key:

   d. Enter `API Key` in Preferences OR at first prompt

## 🗒️ Notes

- Currently, Resend API does not allow you to fetch ALL sent emails. As a workaround, when you send a new email using the extension, it is **logged** locally for your convenience. You can choose to keep or delete logged emails from log (they can still be viewed in your Resend Dashboard at [this link](https://resend.com/emails))
