## üóíÔ∏è Notes

- Currently, Resend API does not allow you to fetch ALL sent emails. As a workaround, when you send a new email using the extension, it is **logged** locally for your convenience. You can choose to keep or delete logged emails from log (they can still be viewed in your Resend Dashboard at [this link](https://resend.com/emails))
