# Mite

Welcome to mite for raycast

## Ideas

- **cache time entries**: analysis of time entries (popular notes, etc.) should be done locally to avoid hitting the mite API every time.
- **un-mock popular projects & services**: popular projects and services are hard-coded at the moment - make them dynamic based on the information in all time entries
- **specify analysis horizon**: allow to specify the analysis horizon (e.g. last month, last year, etc.)
