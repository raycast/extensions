# Mermaid to Image Changelog

## [Add support for AI extension] - {PR_MERGE_DATE}
### Added
- Added a tool (`generateMermaidImageTool`) allowing users to ask Raycast AI to generate Mermaid diagrams (e.g., flowcharts, sequence diagrams) from natural language descriptions and automatically copy the resulting image to the clipboard.
- The new AI tool receives Mermaid syntax (often generated by the AI based on user prompts), utilizes the existing diagram generation engine (`@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`), generates the image according to user preferences (PNG/SVG, theme), and copies the final image to the clipboard.
- Included detailed instructions and examples in `package.json` to guide Raycast AI on accurately interpreting user requests, generating Mermaid syntax, and correctly utilizing the new tool for image generation and copying.
- Registered the AI tool as a `no-view` command, enabling it to be invoked directly by Raycast AI in the background.
- **Added AI Evals:** Implemented evaluation test cases (`evals` in `package.json`) to verify AI interaction with the tool and provide users with example prompts for generating diagrams via AI.
