### Dev Notes

- `useImprovMX` hook to fetch data
- `useImprovMXPaginated` hook to fetch data w/ pagination
- `parseImprovMXResponse` util function is the major shared function
- `fetchAccount` has been removed due to the following:

    1. If user changes their plan and/or email, the change is not reflected if we use the value from LocalStorage
    2. [ImprovMX API Limits](https://help.improvmx.com/getting-started/improvmx-api-rate-limits) are sufficient that we can just get the updated account
