# Lyrics

Search for lyrics to current playing song

## Preferences

`Media Player` (Required): Choose which player to use to get the current track

`Lyrics Provider` (Default: Genius): Choose your preferred lyrics provider. Options: [Genius, Musixmatch]

`Custom Lyrics Provider` (Optional): Enter a custom lyrics provider search URL. Use \* as a placeholder for the search term. (Overrides the lyrics provider setting)

## Development TODO:

- Find a better way to strip parentheses and brackets from the track.
- Maybe add other commands to search on specific platforms instead of based on preference
