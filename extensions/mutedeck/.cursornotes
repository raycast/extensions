# Project Notes

## 2024-02-13
- Project initialized: Raycast extension for MuteDeck integration
- Reviewed architecture requirements and project structure
- Established core features:
  - Microphone mute toggle
  - Video toggle
  - Leave meeting functionality
- Defined initial project structure and implementation plan
- Key technical decisions:
  - Using TypeScript for type safety
  - Following Raycast's recommended extension architecture
  - Implementing real-time status monitoring
  - Robust error handling for common failure cases
- Development Tools Available:
  - Manage Extensions Command (Raycast built-in)
  - CLI tools for build/develop/lint
  - ESLint configuration for best practices
  - VS Code extension (community tool) for enhanced development
- Next steps identified:
  - Set up development environment
  - Create extension scaffold
  - Implement API wrapper
- Setup Progress:
  - ✅ Installed Node.js (v23.5.0) and npm (v10.9.2)
  - ✅ Installed @raycast/api package globally
  - ✅ RESOLVED: Found correct extension creation process
    - Must use Raycast app's built-in "Create Extension" command
    - Will use "Detail" template for rich UI capabilities
    - Development workflow:
      1. Create extension through Raycast app
      2. Run npm install in created directory
      3. Start development with npm run dev
      4. Use VS Code for development
    - No CLI tools needed for initial creation
