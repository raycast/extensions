# Current Thoughts
<SCRATCHPAD>
- Project involves creating a Raycast extension for MuteDeck integration
- Core functionality revolves around meeting controls (mute, video, leave)
- Need to handle real-time status monitoring and error cases
- Architecture follows standard Raycast extension patterns with clear separation of concerns
- Initial focus is on setting up development environment and project structure
- TypeScript will be primary language with React-based UI components
- Error handling strategy needs to be robust for common failure modes
- RESOLVED: Previous CLI tool issues clarified
  - Extension creation should be done through Raycast app's "Create Extension" command
  - No direct npm creation commands needed
  - Will use "Detail" template for rich UI capabilities

POLISH PHASE INSIGHTS:
- Need to follow Bear extension's example for professional quality
- Key areas for polish:
  1. Assets and Visual Identity
     - MuteDeck icon integration
     - Consistent command icons
     - Professional screenshots/GIFs
  2. Documentation Quality
     - Clear, comprehensive README
     - Inline code documentation
     - Usage examples and troubleshooting
  3. Enhanced User Experience
     - Better error messages
     - Loading states
     - Keyboard shortcut suggestions
  4. Code Quality
     - TypeScript strict mode
     - ESLint/Prettier setup
     - Pre-commit hooks
  5. Repository Structure
     - Professional organization
     - Clear contribution guidelines
     - Version history tracking

PROMPT REQUIREMENTS:
- Context from current implementation
- Clear goals for polish phase
- Reference to Bear extension as quality standard
- Step-by-step approach to improvements
- Focus on user experience and professional quality
- Tools and commands needed
- File structure and organization

- Development Tools to Use:
  - ray CLI commands for development:
    - ray develop: Start development mode
    - ray build: Build the extension
    - ray lint: Check code quality
  - VS Code extension for better development experience
  - Manage Extensions command in Raycast for testing
- Next steps:
  - Set up development environment with npm install
  - Start development server with ray develop
  - Implement core functionality using available tools

# Reference Information
- Local API endpoint: http://localhost:3491/
- Key endpoints: status, mute, video, leave
- Must handle: MuteDeck not running, no active meeting, command failures
- Bear extension as reference: https://www.raycast.com/hmarr/bear
- Repository structure example: https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/bear
