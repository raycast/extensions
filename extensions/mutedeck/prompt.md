# MuteDeck Raycast Extension - Polish Phase

## Context

We have a functional Raycast extension for MuteDeck that provides quick meeting controls through Raycast's command interface. The core functionality is complete, including microphone toggle, video toggle, leave meeting, and status display. We're now moving into the polish phase to make it a professional-grade extension.

## Current State

- Core functionality implemented and working
- Basic error handling in place
- Command structure established
- API integration complete

## Goals

Transform the MuteDeck extension into a professional-grade Raycast extension following the example of the Bear extension (https://www.raycast.com/hmarr/bear).

## Reference Implementation

The Bear extension demonstrates several key qualities we want to achieve:

1. Professional documentation with clear value proposition

## Next Steps

1. Set up repository structure
2. Add MuteDeck icon
3. Create documentation
4. Implement enhanced features
5. Polish user experience
6. Set up quality tools
7. Prepare for store submission

## Questions to Consider

1. What is the primary value proposition for users?
2. How can we make the extension more intuitive?
3. What are the common error cases and how should we handle them?
4. How can we make the documentation more helpful?
5. What customization options would be most valuable?

## Success Criteria

1. Professional appearance matching Raycast standards
2. Clear and comprehensive documentation
3. Intuitive user experience
4. Robust error handling
5. High code quality
6. Well-organized repository
7. Store-ready assets
