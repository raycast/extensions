# Internet Radio

Play live internet radio through Music, QuickTime Player, VLC, or Vox. The 36 default stations cover a wide variety of genres, including live news, and you can add custom stations by providing a directly link to the stream URL (e.g. a live broadcast mp3, ogg, acc, pls, or other audio file). You can also view the current station and control playback via a menu bar extra.

Note: When adding URLs, they must be URLs that Music.app can play. For a lot of streams, including many on TuneIn, you can find a direct url to an audio file by observing the network tab in your browserâ€™s inspector.
