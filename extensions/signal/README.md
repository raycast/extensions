# Signal Extension

## Developer details

At the time of writing this, Signal does not offer a public API for users. It only provides application links to
quickly access already existing chats. Until Signal provides a public API, the `Add Chat`
commands will serve for adding the chats to the extension so users can access them from the `Open Chat` command.

When the API is available, the `Add Chat` and `Import Contacts` commands will be obsolete while
new commands such as `Send Message` will become feasible.
