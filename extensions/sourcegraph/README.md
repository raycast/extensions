## Install

To get started, install [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) and [install the Sourcegraph extension from the Raycast extensions store](https://www.raycast.com/bobheadxi/sourcegraph).

Alternatively, you can [install this extension from source](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

<br />

## Setup

This extension adds a [variety of commands](#commands) for interacting with [Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com).
Some configuration is required to use certain features, most notably the [variants of each command for Sourcegraph Self-Hosted](#sourcegraph-self-hosted), though you can get started with [Sourcegraph Cloud commands](#sourcegraph-cloud) without any additional setup.

### Sourcegraph Cloud

No setup is required to connect to [Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com/search)!
To search your private code, configure your own [search contexts](#search-contexts), create your own search notebooks, and more, [sign up for a Sourcegraph Cloud account](https://sourcegraph.com/sign-up)!

Once you have an account, you can create an access token under the "Access tokens" tab in your user settings on [Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com).
Copy that access token to the "Sourcegraph Cloud: Access token" field in the Sourcegraph Raycast extension preferences to authenticate your search queries.

### Sourcegraph Self-Hosted

To start searching code on a [self-hosted Sourcegraph instance](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install), you can set up access to any Sourcegraph instance by configuring the "Sourcegraph Self-Hosted: Instance URL" and "Sourcegraph Self-Hosted: Access token" fields in the Sourcegraph Raycast extension preferences.
You can create an access token under the "Access tokens" tab in your user settings on your Sourcegraph instance.

<br />

## Commands

### Search Code

Get results as you type on [code search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/code-search) over your code and 2M+ public repositories.

#### Search contexts

[Search contexts](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/explanations/features#search-contexts) allow you to narrow down your search to code you care about.
To get started, you can try the [public Sourcegraph Cloud contexts](https://sourcegraph.com/contexts), or configure your own in your Sourcegraph Cloud account or self-hosted Sourcegraph instance's "Contexts" page!

The Sourcegraph Raycast extension allows you to set a default context for your searches in the "Search Code" command preferences.

### Find Search Notebooks

Browse and preview [search notebooks](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/notebooks) straight from Raycast.
Notebooks enable powerful live – and persistent – documentation, shareable with your organization or the world.

To get started, you can try the [public Sourcegraph Cloud notebooks](https://sourcegraph.com/notebooks?tab=explore), or configure your own from your Sourcegraph Cloud account or self-hosted Sourcegraph instance!

![notebooks](metadata/3-notebook-view.png)

### Manage Batch Changes

Browse, view, publish, and merge changesets for [batch changes](https://about.sourcegraph.com/batch-changes) straight from Raycast.
Batch changes automate large-scale code changes to keep your code up to date, fix critical security issues, and pay down tech debt across all of your repositories.

Batch changes is currently only supported on [Sourcegraph Self-Hosted](#sourcegraph-self-hosted).

Updates will be regularly published to the [Raycast Extensions repository](https://github.com/raycast/extensions) from the [`bobheadxi/raycast-sourcegraph` repository](https://github.com/bobheadxi/raycast-sourcegraph).
To try out yet-to-be-published changes, you can [install this extension from source](./CHANGELOG.md).
