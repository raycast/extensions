# TechCrunch news for Raycast

This is a simple extension that allows you to read [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com) news. It works directly in Raycast, no external applications or dependencies are required 


## Commands

- [x] Added "All streams" section
- [x] Publication time added

### Not Yet Implemented

- [ ] I'd really like to supplement this extension with TechCrunch categories, but I've only been able to find RSS with popular news stories. If you can help me find RSS for the other categories, I would be happy to add them to the extension
