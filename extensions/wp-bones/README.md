## Overview

[WP Bones](https://wpbones.com) is a lightweight framework that offers tools and guidelines to simplify WordPress plugin development. Bones aims to allow you to write plugins in a manner similar to developing a Laravel Framework application.

Sadly, WordPress architecture doesn’t currently support composer/vendor philosophy yet. This is why some amazing features of composer/vendor architecture can’t apply yet.

Also, see Before submit to WordPress repository section for more coding restrictions information.

The aim of this framework is to use both new and standard development tools in a WordPress environment. If you like Composer, npm, Laravel and Gulp, here is the framework for you.

### I ❤️ love Laravel
If you know Laravel Framework, you will love WP Bones Framework too. I was inspired by Laravel while developing WP Bones. Even though, as you can imagine, the WordPress environment doesn’t support Composer as we wished. So, you will find a lot of things similar to Laravel and some others very different.
