- **Markdown to HTML**: Converts AI output to Zendesk-compatible HTML
- **Smart Categorization**: Suggests appropriate Help Center sections

### **Best Practices**
- Use for tickets with clear problem resolution patterns
- Review and edit AI-generated content before publishing
- Ensure the ticket contains enough detail for good article generation
- Consider using this for common support scenarios and FAQs
