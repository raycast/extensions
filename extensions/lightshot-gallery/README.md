### You'll need to get your Auth Key. Lightshow does not provide any official way to do this, so here's how to do it:
- Open [prnt.sc]("https://prnt.sc")
- Make sure to be logged into your account
- Open the developer tools of your browser (mostly Cmd + Option/Alt + I)
- Go in the Application or Storage tab of thre developer tools
- Click on the cookies and search for a cookie named "__auth"
#### ðŸŽ‰ This is your Auth Key! You can enter this in the extension preferences.

Note: logging out of [prnt.sc](https://prnt.sc) in the browser you used to retrieve the auth key will also log you out in this extension
