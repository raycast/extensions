# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Memory bank creation and setup
- Understanding the project structure and requirements
- Identifying key components and their relationships
- Implementation of Limitless Pendant transcription support
- Version 1.3.0 release
- Memory bank maintenance and documentation
- Fixing indentation hierarchy for bullet points under headings (PR #11)
- Setting up Prettier formatting and integrating it into build process
- Cleaning up test directory structure and removing duplicate test files (Issue #12)

## Recent Changes
- Version 1.2.0 (2025-04-03):
  - Added support for YouTube transcript timestamps as separate nodes in Tana
  - Added comprehensive Jest testing infrastructure
  - Fixed text formatting preservation (bold formatting)
  - Corrected indentation hierarchy for numbered headings
- Version 1.3.0 (2025-04-03):
  - Added support for Limitless Pendant transcription format (#8)
  - Improved hierarchical indentation for transcriptions
- Bug fix (2025-04-03):
  - Fixed indentation hierarchy for bullet points under H3+ headings (PR #11)
  - Improved handling of Limitless Pendant transcription indentation
  - Made tests more flexible and less brittle by checking content instead of exact spacing
- Developer experience improvements (2025-04-05):
  - Added Prettier configuration and scripts for automatic code formatting
  - Integrated formatting and linting into build and development processes
  - Updated development workflow to run build before committing changes

## Active Decisions
- Memory bank structure established to document project context
- Documentation approach focusing on modular components
- Dual implementation strategy (Raycast + Python) maintained for different use cases
- Implemented a simplified "{Speaker}: {Content}" format for Limitless Pendant transcriptions
- Designed proper hierarchical indentation with speaker content nested under section headers
- Maintained consistent implementation across both TypeScript and Python versions
- Focused on comprehensive testing to ensure proper behavior
- Established code formatting standards with Prettier
- Added pre-commit practice to run build for formatting, linting, and testing
- GitHub CLI issue creation must avoid newlines in command parameters (use spaces or commas instead)

## Next Steps
- Review core conversion logic in `tana-converter.ts` to understand implementation details
- Examine test coverage and identify any gaps
- Explore potential new features from unreleased changes
- Identify opportunities for improvement in the conversion process
- Consider how to handle more complex Markdown structures
- Continue monitoring PR #18361 for the Raycast store submission
- Consider additional special format support for common transcription tools
- Update documentation with more examples for the new features
- Consider improved formatting options for transcriptions

## Current Challenges
- Understanding the specific requirements of Tana's format
- Tracking edge cases in the conversion process
- Balancing performance with comprehensive conversion capabilities
- Managing the dual implementation approach (TypeScript and Python)
- Balancing proper indentation with ease of use in Tana
- Ensuring consistent behavior across different transcription formats
- Managing formatting variations in different input sources

## Open Questions
- What are the most common error cases in the conversion process?
- Are there any Markdown elements not currently supported?
- How does the system handle very large documents?
- What improvements could be made to the current implementation?
- What other transcription formats might need special support?
- How can we improve the detection of different transcription formats?
- Are there additional formatting options users might need for transcriptions?
- How can we make the extension more discoverable for users of transcription tools?
