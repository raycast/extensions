Invoke the Hookmark Window: Use the default shortcut Control + H to open the Hookmark window. From here, you can link, copy, and manage items quickly.
Copy Links: Generate a link to any file, webpage, email, or task by selecting Copy Link (Cmd +C) in the Hookmark window. This puts the link on your clipboard, ready to paste where you need.
Hook Items Together: Connect two items — like a note and a PDF or an email and a task — using the Hook to Copied Link (Cmd + V) command. This creates a bidirectional link, i.e., a 'hook,' so each item references the other.
