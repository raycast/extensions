  - Insights
    - OLG has requested modifications to a feedback training module, specifically:
      - Making it more performance-driven with examples of performance-based behaviors
      - Adding content about handling emotional reactions during feedback (from the appendix)
    - The team has limited time to implement changes as the session is scheduled for April 14th
    - The requested modifications align with feedback they've received from other learners who wanted more content on handling responses/pushback during feedback
    - The team previously removed content about handling emotional reactions because it made the session too long
