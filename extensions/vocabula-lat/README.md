# Vocabula.lat

Search on the Latin dictionary [Vocabula](https://vocabula.lat) from the command line.

# Search for words
You can search for words the same way you would on the website. The extension will return all results, which sometimes might be a bit confusing as there are different entries for the same word.

# Search for abbreviations
You can search for abbreviations as well. The extension will return all results, which sometimes might be a bit confusing as there are different entries for the same abbreviation.

# Missing features
Extension does not support search in the Czech Dictionary of Medieval Latin as the website does. Is is partially due to copyright concerns, but also because it uses a different response format than the main dictionary.
