# Drafts

This extension integrates Raycast with [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com).  
Created by [@FlohGro](https://social.lol/@flohgro) ([Website](https://flohgro.com/)).

It supports the following features as commands:

## Create Draft in Background / Create and Open Draft

Create drafts in a Raycast form with tags (either with opening it afterwards or in the background).

## Capture Draft

Quickly capture content from command argument into a new draft in the background.

## Append/Prepend to Draft

Configure Drafts you often want to append / prepend text to.

To configure a Draft you need to copy its UUID in Drafts from the *Info Menu* of the Draft. You can choose a title that should be displayed in Raycast for this Draft and select if you want to prepend or append text to that Draft.

When you configured Drafts you can quickly prepend / append text to the selected Draft in the list.

It is also very easy to create a Raycast Quicklink to perform the prepending / appending even faster.

## Create Draft from Clipboard

Creates a new Draft with the current Clipboard text as content.

## Create blank Draft

Quickly create a new empty Draft and open it in Drafts app.

## Run Draft Action

Configure Actions you want to run from Raycast.

Depending on your configuration Raycast will ask for text input you want to provide to the Drafts Action or run the Action without any text input.

## Open Drafts Workspace

Configure Workspaces you want to quickly open from Raycast.

You can configure as many workspaces as you like by their name and open them from the workspaces list in Raycast.

In the Action Panel of each configured workspace you can also create a Raycast Quicklink for the workspace to open it even faster.

## Dictate Draft

Open the dictation interface in Drafts to quickly create a new Draft from dictated text.

## Create Drafts Quicklink

This is a helper command to easily create additional Raycast Quicklinks to perform the following actions:

- create a draft
- open the quicksearch in Drafts
- search in the drafts list
- search in the Action list
- capture text with Drafts capture window
- open the dictation window

## Create Open Draft Quicklink

Create a Raycast Quicklink to open a Draft by passing a title and the UUID of the Draft.

Tip: Use it together with the corresponding [Drafts Action](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/2RC) to easily create Quicklinks for currently open Drafts.
