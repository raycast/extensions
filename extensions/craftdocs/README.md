## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Blocks Search** | Search across all your Craft documents and blocks |
| **Daily Notes** | Navigate to and manage your daily notes |
| **Append to Daily Note** | Add content to today's daily note |
| **Manage Spaces** | Rename spaces and control their visibility |

## Configuration

### Application Selection

If you have multiple versions of Craft installed (regular and Setapp), you can specify which one to use in the extension preferences.

### Search Preferences

- **Detailed View**: Toggle between compact and detailed search results
- Shows document content as a simplified preview

### Daily Notes Preferences

- **Append Position**: Choose whether new content goes at the beginning or end
- **Add Timestamp**: Automatically include current time with new entries
- **Content Prefix/Suffix**: Add custom text before and after your content

### Space Management

- **Custom Names**: Give your spaces names instead of using Space IDs
- **Space Filtering**: Use the dropdown in search commands to filter by specific spaces
- **Enable/Disable**: Hide unused spaces from all commands while keeping them accessible in Craft
- **Persistent Settings**: Your space preferences are saved and synchronized across all commands

## How It Works

The extension uses Craft's local SQLite database to provide fast, offline search across all your documents. It leverages full-text search (FTS5) for efficient querying and supports all spaces that Craft has synced locally.

Since Craft does not yet provide an API, all functions related to document creation are implemented through [Craft's URL Scheme](https://support.craft.do/hc/en-us/articles/360020168838-Using-URL-Scheme).

## Troubleshooting

### Search Results Not Appearing

Ensure Craft is installed and has synced your documents. The extension can only search through documents once the local database is set up.

### Multiple Craft Versions

If you have both regular and Setapp versions installed, specify your preferred version in the extension preferences under "Application to search in".

### Performance Issues

The extension performs best when Craft has finished syncing. Large document collections may take a moment to index initially.

### Space Management Issues

If renamed spaces don't appear correctly, try refreshing the extension or restarting Raycast. Space settings are stored locally and persist between sessions.
