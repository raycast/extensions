# Doppler - Share Secrets and Search Projects

This is a Raycast extension for [Doppler](https://doppler.com/). Doppler makes it easy to securely share sensitive information such as API keys or passwords. It also allows you to view your Projects with their Configs, Environments and Secrets.

An extensive walk-through on how to build such an extension can be found on the [developers docs](https://developers.raycast.com/examples/doppler).
