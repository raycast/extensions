### Raycast Tides

This is a simple extention that lets you view when high and low tide is at your favorite NOAA stations.

> [!NOTE]
> Because this uses NOAA stations it only has data for US stations. Find a list of stations [here](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html).

### Example

Open raycast and run the "View Tides" command.

![View tides command](/images/view_tides_cmd.png)

Then type "Boston" or "Boston, MA" to see the tides for Boston.

### Quick start

Install the require dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the extension in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should be able to find the "Hello" command in Raycast!
