## 🎯 Understanding Prompt Enhancement

### Why Enhance Prompts?

Raw prompts often lack structure and context, leading to:
- ❌ Vague or unfocused responses
- ❌ Missing important details
- ❌ Inconsistent output quality
- ❌ Difficulty reproducing good results

Enhanced prompts provide:
- ✅ Clear objectives and success criteria
- ✅ Proper context and constraints
- ✅ Structured format requirements
- ✅ Consistent, reproducible results

### The Enhancement Process

Promptify follows a proven framework:

1. **Objective**: What exactly do you want to achieve?
2. **Context**: What background information is relevant?
3. **Format**: How should the output be structured?
4. **Criteria**: How will you know if it's successful?
