# Universal Commands

Sometimes, I encounter difficulties in finding the right shortcut for the same action across different applications. For instance, various meeting platforms like Google Meet, Slack Huddle, and Zoom each have different shortcuts for muting the microphone. Furthermore, in Slack, the ability to rebind shortcuts is limited.

To address this issue, the solution is the Universal Commands extension for Raycast. This extension provides users with the ability to configure commands to execute specific shortcuts **based on the application in use**. As a result, users can use a single command to toggle between mute and unmute, and this action will be tailored to the current application and execute the corresponding shortcut.

## Features

- Execute common shortcuts with a single Raycast command.
- Automatically detects the active application and applies the relevant shortcut.
- Easily extensible to apply actions to every application or website.

## Getting Started

- Install the Universal Shortcut Extension from the Raycast Store.
- You will have a default pre-configured command, "Toggle Mute/Unmute," that you can start using right away, or you can build your own command.
- Save the command as a Raycast Quicklink and configure it separately (recommended).
