# Hyrule Compendium

This extension allows you to conveniently search and access information from the Hyrule Compendium.

It uses the Hyrule Compendium API by [Aarav Borthakur](https://github.com/gadhagod)

Available categories:
- Monsters
- Equipment
- Materials
- Creatures

The extension uses fuzzy search (fuse.js) to search for the entry you inputted, it doesent matter if you made a typo or didnt use the complete name, it still works!

You can find it [here](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/)

P.S: This is my first extension so please provide any feedback!
