## ⚙️ Advanced Settings

- **Stability** (0.0 - 1.0): Controls voice consistency. Higher values make the voice more stable but potentially less expressive.
- **Similarity Boost** (0.0 - 1.0): Adjusts how closely the output matches the original voice. Higher values increase similarity but may impact performance.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Use shorter text segments for faster response times
- Experiment with different stability settings for each voice to find your perfect balance
- The extension works with any text-based application including browsers, editors, and documents

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

- If no sound plays, check your API key and internet connection
- Ensure you have sufficient credits in your ElevenLabs account
- For long texts, consider breaking them into smaller segments
