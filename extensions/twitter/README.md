## Login

The login works with `Login with Twitter`. `Login with Twitter` is activate as long as no access tokens are set in the extension preferences.
When access tokens are set, the keys will be used for authentication and authorization instead of `Login with Twitter`. Also the API keys approach use `v1` of the Twitter API.
`Login with Twitter` use v2.

### How to get the access token for the Twitter API (optional)

This step is optional and is not required for normal usage.

- Goto https://apps.twitter.com
- Register as developer
- Create an app (this will be displayed next to your tweets)
- Store the App-Key and the App-Secret in a secure(!) box
- Then adjust the required permissions

  Per default it is `read-only`. This is fine if you only want to read tweets.

  If you want to e.g. like, retweet or send tweets, you should have at least `read + write`.

  <b style="color:red">Make sure that you change the permission before creating user access tokens. You can only change permission for an existing user access token by revoking/regenerate the tokens. Clients which use the old tokens would not work anymore!</b>

- Create User access tokens

After all these steps you should have all required 4 tokens.

- API Key/App Key
- API Secret/App Secret
- User Access Key
- User Access Token

Store them in a secure box, twitter want display that again for you.

You also need to activate `OAuth 1.0a` for at least `v1` API, otherwise you will get an `403` error. Activate `v2` is recommended, but right no not required.

- Click on your Twitter app on https://apps.twitter.com 
- Navigate to `User authentication settings`
- Press `Set up`
  - Activate `OAuth 1.0a`
  - Choose your App permissions as you like
  - Set `https://raycast.com/redirect` as `Callback URI` 
  - Set `https://raycast.com` as Website URL
  - Press on `Save`

## v1 vs v2 API
Twitter has 2 APIs - `v1` and `v2`. Your Twitter app needs to have enabled `v1` access when you use access tokens, otherwise you will get a `403` error.
The `v2` API of Twitter is still in progress and not all features are available.

### Actual impl. differences between v1 and v2 mode in this extension

-  `v2` use 2 actions for `Like` and `Unlike` (v1 use one action which change it's state based on if the tweet is liked or not), because there is no way in v2 if the current user liked a given tweet or not
- Retweet works as in `v1`, but un-retweet action needs to be done on the retweet itself. In `v1` it was done on the original one.
- Search User command open twitter.com in the browser instead of show the result because there is no API for that in `v2`
