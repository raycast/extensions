## GitHub Access Token

You will need to acquire a personal access token to authenticate with GitHub, because the extension fetches data from a remote GitHub repository. Please see the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for more information.
