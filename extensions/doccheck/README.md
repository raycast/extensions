## Using the Extension
On first start, the content of the [Main Page](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Hauptseite) is displayed: top articles, newly created and freshly improved articles, suggestions for articles you can write or improve. This content is cached and refreshed every hour by default (you can change this `Refresh Interval` in settings).

An (already existing) article can be opened directly in Raycast (⏎ or →), in the browser (via ⌘+⏎) or the title can be used as search text in the AMBOSS search (via ⌥+⏎). You can also copy the article URL directly to the clipboard (via ⌘+C).

Once you have opened an article, you can press ⇧ with the above mentioned keys to search for the original search term entered (if you have opened the article from a search) and open the displayed article in edit mode in your browser (via ⌘+E). If you click on a link, the following article will also open directly in Raycast by default (you can change this `Navigate in` to browser in settings), you can then go back and forth with the arrow keys (← or →) or (if you have clicked through some articles and do not want to press ← repeatedly) return to the home page with ⌘+H.

While you are browsing DocCheck, a history of your last visited articles is created. By default, the 3 most recently visited articles are displayed on the home page. You can change the `Number of history items on the home page` or turn it off in settings.
