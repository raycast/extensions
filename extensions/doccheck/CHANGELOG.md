# DocCheck Changelog

## [Version 2.1] - 2023-07-21
- NEW: Favourites - pin an article to the main screen, you will see a "★" in front of the navigation title at the bottom if the article is a favourite (shortcut to favourite and unfavourite: ⌘ + F; you can also unfavourite an article in Home)
- NEW: option to force reload Home with ⌘ + R

- NEW: show toast while fetching "Top Artikel", searching or loading an article
- NEW: show toast when you try to favourite an unloaded article
- Fixed: better support for links to non-existing articles (history and favourites now shows articles not yet written with a plus icon instead of a book in Home; there is no more Invalid last update date and ⏎ will open a browser so you can start writing this missing article; the error toast now shows a correct "Not found" message when opened)
- Fixed: Home is updated automatically (shows history items immediately, and also new favourites, unfavourites)
- Fixed: You can now read articles in the "Verbessere" section in raycast, instead of only editing them in the browser
- Fixed: Images with links are now displayed correctly (without returns, see e.g. article [Enterostoma](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Enterostoma))
- Fixed: display error when article is not loaded and therefore cannot be favoured
- Fixed: some under the hood improvements (more unique listkeys in Home, check if item is still loading before you can bookmark it)

## [Version 2.0] - 2023-06-08
- NEW: Home - completely redesigned main screen shows the History from the last read articles (see below), "Neu erstellt", "Frisch verbessert", "Schreib über", "Verbessere" in addition to the "Top Artikel" (information from the [main page](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Hauptseite))
- NEW: Cache - all of the above is now cached (you can change the time for a refresh in settings)
- NEW: Full Navigation - you can now go back and forth (like in a browser, pro-tip: use the arrow keys (← or →); on the first page you now go back via `pop` (same functionality as using the esc key), so you don't lose context)
- NEW: History - by default the last 3 articles are shown on the new home screen (you can change the number of entries in settings)
- NEW: Copy URL of current article with ⌘ + U
- NEW: open edit URL of current article in browser with ⌘ + E
