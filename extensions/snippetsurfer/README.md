# SnippetSurfer

SnippetSurfer is a Raycast extension designed to swiftly navigate through snippets of information. You can effortlessly skim through text excerpts, code snippets, or any other brief segments of content and copy them to the clipboard. The snippets are read from a folder of Markdown or YAML files.

Note: This extension does not work with built-in [Raycast snippets](https://manual.raycast.com/snippets). It uses its own snippets that you have to set up and maintain.

### Getting Started

After installing this extension, go to its settings and select a *Primary Snippet Folder*. This can be any folder on your machine. You can also choose a *Secondary Snippet Folder* to load snippets from another place.

After selecting the folder, you can create your snippets by creating one or more Markdown or YAML files, each containing a collection of snippets.

### Features

- Raycast extension for quick navigation of text excerpts and code snippets.
- Supports filtering by folders or subfolders and by tags.
- Supports both yaml and markdown formats for easy organization.
    - For markdown files, YAML Metadata support enables addition of titles and descriptions to snippets for better organization.
- Streamlines personal workflows by automatically copying code snippets to the clipboard.
- Automatically copies only the content inside code snippets for code snippets.

      Incorporates changes from a remote repository
