# ðŸ”Ž Tmux Command Lookup for Raycast

Tmux Command Lookup is a Raycast extension built with TypeScript and React that provides a comprehensive, searchable cheatsheet for tmux commands. The extension groups commands by category (e.g., Session Commands, Window Commands, Pane Commands, etc.) and displays detailed information about each command, including the terminal syntax and default keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- **Grouped Command List**  
  When launching the extension with no search text, commands are organized by category:
  - Session Commands
  - Window Commands
  - Pane Commands
  - Resize Commands
  - Copy/Paste Commands
  - Layout & Options
  - Miscellaneous Commands

- **Flat Search View**  
  As soon as you start typing in the search bar, the extension displays a flat, filtered list of commands matching your query.

- **Detailed Command View**  
  Select a command to view its details in a Markdown-formatted view that includes:
  - The terminal command in a code block
  - Keyboard shortcuts and usage instructions
  - Helpful tips for remapping the tmux prefix

- **Copy to Clipboard**  
  Easily copy any command to your clipboard with a single click.
