Port functionalities from [cursor.directory](https://cusor.directory) for Cursor Code Editor.

## Usage

Simply launch Raycast and input `cursor directory` to launch the command.

It will do the fuzzy search based on the title of prompt, and then select the prompt to view the detail or directly copy the content via Action Panel.

You can also type `Enter` key to open the detail page, where author information and full prompt are displayed.

Then you can copy the prompt via `Enter` key, or directory go the `cursor.directory`, share the link via Action Panel.

## TODOs

This plugin will try to port the functionalities as much as possible when `cursor.directory` evolves.

Feedbacks and contributions are always welcome.
