# Incognito Clone

Open the URL of the currently active tab in an Incognito (Chromium-based) or private (Webkit-based) browser window.

## Supported Browsers

Google Chrome, Chromium, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave Browser, Microsoft Edge, Arc, and Safari.

Webkit-based browsers do not support opening new private windows programmatically. The command instead tries to simulate the corresponding keyboard shortcut (⇧⌘N). Depending on your setup, this might conflict with other settings.
