# Luna Search Changelog

## [Bug fix] - 2024-08-28

- Off by 1 error in the menu-bar command fix (Top 5 games is now 5, not 6)

## [Menu Bar Command, Bug Fixes & Optimizations] - 2024-08-24

- Added a new menu-bar command that supports quickly accessing the most recent games the user interacted with and the top 5 trending games.
- Noticed a bug with the late-breaking pagination feature - this is fixed! No more errors.
- Internal refactoring should make Luna Search a little more snappy and a little less janky.
