# Hideapp

Got that urge to tidy up and hide stuff you’re not using? Just pick the app you want to hide and watch it disappear—like magic.

Even better, the app won’t pop onto your screen before vanishing, so you can safely tuck away that weird picture in Preview without anyone spotting it during your weekly screen share. Happy hiding!
