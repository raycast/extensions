# Raycast Jira Search
This [Raycast](https://raycast.com) extension lets you quickly find Jira issues, projects, boards and filters.

## Features
* Find issues by text and project and type, where the text search is much more tolerant than the one built in to Raycast.
  * Filter issues by project using `@project` syntax.
  * Filter issue by type using `#issueType` syntax.
  * For example enter `pdf export @dev @it #bug #story` to find all issues which contain words starting with "pdf" and "export" and which are in the "DEV" or "IT" project and which are of type "Bug" or "Story."
  * Find issue directly by issue key (for example `DEV-1234`).
* Find projects by title.
* Find boards by title.
* Find filters by title.
* Use the following actions on found entities:
  * Open in browser
  * Copy URL
  * Copy markdown link
  * Copy HTML link

**Note:** This extension does not provide an issue preview or issue editing like the built-in extension – it is totally focused on quickly opening Jira entities in your browser.

## Setup
To connect the extension to your Jira instance you need to fill the following prefernces:

* **Jira Domain:** The domain of your Jira cloud instance like `mycompany.atlassian.net`.
