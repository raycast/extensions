# Title

Capitalize your titles properly with Title Case, as per [_The Chicago Manual of Style_](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).

You can either write a new title inside the extension, or capitalize an existing one.

For the quickest workflow, do the following:

1. Select and copy the title you want to capitalize.
2. Open the extension. It defaults to your your clipboard content.
3. Press CMD + Enter to paste the result into active application, thus replacing your selection.
