# Quicklinks Automation

While using Raycast, many times I felt like I needed to use more than one quicklink in a row, but I couldn't figure a way to do so in just one click.
This extension aims at solving this issue.
**Quicklinks Automation** allows the user to create automations containing a set of quicklinks that will be called sequentially. Each automation needs to be given a name, and can be called using the `Run Automation` command.
