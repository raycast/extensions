# Web Audit Raycast Extension

This Raycast Extension lets you audit a given webpage in a matter of seconds. It's made to showcase all critical data and tell you what is not optimized yet.

## How to use it?

### 1. Install the Extension
If the Extension gets approved you will find it in the Raycast Store.
You can install the extension via the `import extension` command directly in Raycast.

### 2. Use the command
The command for starting the Extension is `Analyze Website [https://raycast.com/]`.

### 3. Type in the Website URL
You now can type in the website url of your choice into the input field. Please note that you have to give the full adress inclusive `https://`.

### 4. Wait and look at the results
After a few milliseconds you should see your results and some information about the website on the right side.
