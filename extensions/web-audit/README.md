# Web Audit Raycast Extension

This Raycast Extension lets you audit a given webpage in a matter of seconds. It's made to showcase all critical data and tell you what is not optimized yet.

## How to use it?

### 1. Install the Extension

If the Extension gets approved you will find it in the Raycast Store.
You can install the extension via the `import extension` command directly in Raycast.

### 2. Use the command

The command for starting the Extension is `Analyze Website [https://raycast.com/]`. You can use any URL you want, if it is not reachable or you don't type the URL in including a protocol, the extension will throw an error. You can press `⌘T` to see some more information on how to fix the issues.

### 3. Wait and look at the results

After a few seconds you should see your results and some information about the website on the right side.
