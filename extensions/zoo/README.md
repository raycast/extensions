## How to Use?

The workflow should be like:

1. Create a gist (prompt) as you need, e,g, `Summarize the text`.
2. Select text and call the zoo `ask by prompt on Selected Text` command.
3. choose one prompt from the list (you can use navigate bar to filter prompt).
4. execute the prompt on the selected text; you can copy the result as you want.
