Never leave your editor to check component themes again. Access Nuxt UI documentation instantly while you code.

## ⚡️ Current Feature

### Quick Theme Access
Jump directly to any component's theme documentation in milliseconds:
- Select your component name
- Trigger the command
- Land exactly where you need to be

No more context switching, no more manual searching. Just smooth, uninterrupted development.

### Ask Nuxt UI
Ask Nuxt UI for information, tips, create components, etc... with natural language, here's some examples:
- Create a welcoming button for my users
- How many components are there in Nuxt UI?
- Make a faq component

### Smart Configuration
Customize the component prefix to match your style:
- Default: "U" (UButton, UInput...)
- Fully customizable to fit your workflow

### Version Support
Works seamlessly with both Nuxt UI versions:
- Full support for Nuxt UI v3
- Compatible with Nuxt UI v2 (you may have some issues with the component names)
- Easy version switching in preferences

## Demo

I recommend you to put the shortcut to execute the command directly on `✦ + U` for example or `⌘ + U`.

- 🔍 Lightning-fast component search
- 📝 Instant code examples
- 💡 Smart suggestions
- ⚙️ Quick props access
