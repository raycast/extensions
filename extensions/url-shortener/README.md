# URL Shortener

A URL shortener unlike anything you've seen before on the Raycast extension store . . . 

- **No API keys required**
    - No prior setup necessary
- **Completely FREE**. 
    - The power is *limitless*
- Choose from multiple URL shortening domains, including **TinyURL** and **Shrtcode** 
- The *fastest way* to shorten any URL
    - No need to fill out any forms. 
        - A no-view extension
        - Extension only uses selected text
        - Perfect for using a hotkey! (I personally use `^L`)
    - You still have the option to use arguments (instead of selected text) to paste in a URL if you'd like
- Choose how Raycast handles the shortened URL
    - Paste to Active Window
    - Or Copy to Clipboard
