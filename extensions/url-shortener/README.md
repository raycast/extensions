# URL Shortener

A URL shortener unlike anything you've seen before on the Raycast extension store . . . 

- **No API keys required**
    - No prior setup necessary
- **Completely FREE**. 
- choose from multiple URL shortening domains, including **TinyURL** and **Shrtcode.** 
- the *fastest way* to shorten any URL,
    - no need to fill out any forms. 
        - a no-view extension
        - extension only uses selected text
        - perfect for using a hotkey! (I personally use `^L`)
- choose how you handle the shortened URL
    - Paste to Active Window
    - Or Copy to Clipboard
