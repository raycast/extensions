<p align="center" style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Get reminded on what is your current focus</p>

## How it works

1. Run both the `Current Focus` and `Menu Bar` commands to have the full experience.
2. Use any of the commands to set your current focus.
    - `Set Focus` will allow you to manually input a focus.
    - `Clipboard Focus` will use the contents of your clipboard as the focus.
    - `Selected Text Focus` will use the selected text as the focus.
    - `Application Focus` will set the focus using the frontmost application. (e.g. the current tab in your
      browser, [see below](#supported-applications))
3. Assign one of more shortcuts for the focus set command you use most.
4. Set the `Current Focus` command as a favorite so you see your current focus when you open Raycast.
5. You will be reminded every 1 minute of your current focus with a HUD and in the menu bar (the interval can be changed
   in the extension settings).
6. If you are in a meeting or wish to stop seeing a reminder run the `Pause Reminder` command.

### Supported Applications

The command `Application Focus` is really useful to set your current focus using the frontmost application. It is
supported by the following applications:

- **Apple Mail**: Selected email subject
- **Things 3**: Selected task title
- **Safari**: Current tab title
- **Google Chrome**: Current tab title
- **Arc**: Current tab title
- **Brave Browser**: Current tab title

I would love to develop this extension as a standalone pay product because there are some many possibilities to
improve it. If you would like to support me in this endeavour please submit feedback or contact me at.
