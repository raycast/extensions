# Quest

> Create and work on checklists.

**Quest** is a simple - *Raycast native* - app that allows you to create and work on checklists. Based on [The Checklist Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto) you know checklists can save lives and make you more productive by improving the quality of repetitive tasks. **Quest** lets you create, edit and delete checklists (quests). You can easily start working on them and keep track of the progress.

## How it works

1. Call `Show Quests`.
2. Add a Quest (Checklist) by pressing `CMD+N`.
3. Give it a name and press `CMD+'+'` to add tasks. Finally add the quest by pressing `CMD+Enter`.
4. Now select the Quest and press `Enter` to start working on it. Check off tasks by pressing `Enter`.
5. Once you're done with a Quest, export a markdown report by pressing `CMD+T` → `Export Markdown`.

## Import & Export Quests

You can easily share your quests with others by exporting them with `CMD+.`. This will copy a stringified JSON to you clipboard. You can also import quests from others by having a valid stringified quest definition in your clipboard during quest creation.
