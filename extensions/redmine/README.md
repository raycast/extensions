# Raycast Redmine

This [Raycast](https://raycast.com) extension lets you quickly find [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org) issues.

## Features

- Find your currently assigned issues, filter using Raycast by issue ID or subject keywords.
- Configure the list item dot color based on the Priority names your instance might use. Note: this is currently limited to Red / Orange / Blue and No Color for the rest
- Use the following actions on found entities:
  - Open in browser
  - Copy URL
  - Copy markdown link
  - Copy HTML link

**Note:** This extension does not provide an issue preview or issue editing like the built-in extension â€“ it is totally focused on quickly opening Redmine issues in your browser.
