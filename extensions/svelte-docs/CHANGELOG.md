# Svelte Docs Changelog

## [Support for new Svelte Omnisite] - 2021-11-04

The new Svelte Omnisite is live and with it the docs are all in one neat place. As of today the extension is updated to fetch from the right place and link to the right place. And even better, you now have the ability to search for the docs of the CLI too, as well as take a look at the Tutorial or some example REPL...all with a couple of clicks within Raycast!

## [Initial Version] - 2024-01-08
