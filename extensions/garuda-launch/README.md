# Garuda Launch

**Garuda Launch** is a Raycast extension that gives you lightning-fast access to your favorite developer apps and project folders. Inspired by the mythical Garuda, it soars through your local projects and lets you open any repo in up to ten different applications with a single hotkey.

## 📦 Features

1. **Configurable Projects Path**

   - Set your “Projects Directory” once in Raycast Preferences.
   - Garuda Launch will list every sub-folder inside that directory as a “repo.”

2. **Multi-Stage Setup Flow**

   - **Stage 1: Apps Selection**
     - Pick up to 10 `.app` bundles from your `/Applications` folder.
     - Drag-and-drop tags to reorder—this defines your hotkey mapping.
   - **Stage 2: Projects Selection**
     - Select any repo in your Projects Directory.
     - Instantly open in your chosen apps via Cmd+1, Cmd+2, … Cmd+9, Cmd+0.

3. **Hotkey Mapping**

   - `⌘ + 1` → Open in first-chosen app
   - `⌘ + 2` → Open in second-chosen app
   - …
   - `⌘ + 0` → Open in tenth-chosen app

4. **Zero Text, Plenty of Speed**
   - No typing paths or app names.
