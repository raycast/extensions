# Claris Snippets

Create and use snippets for Claris (FileMaker) Pro.

This extension uses FmClipTools to capture transform the FileMaker clipboard data to FM Objects, saving the XML representation of the snippet to a file on disk. You can specify multiple folders on your computer on which to save your snippets, allowing you to share collections of snippets with other developers, or sync that folder with a team using a cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive.

## How to use

To create a new snippet, copy something to the clipboard from FileMaker. This can be a script, script step, layout objects, field definitions, etc. Then use the "Create Snippet" command and fill out the form to give the snippet a name, description, and optional keywords.

To use a previously saved snippet, open the "View Snippets" command and search for the snippet you want to use. Then simply press the return key to copy that snippet to your clipboard as a FileMaker object, ready for the pasting!
