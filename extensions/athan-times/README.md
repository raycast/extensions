an extension to show prayer times for muslims (Athan Times)

For quite some time, I wanted to develop an extension for Raycast. At the same time, I also wanted to learn TypeScript. so I hit two birds with one stone ðŸ˜—!

## APIs Used

This extension relies on the following APIs to fetch data:

- [Country State City API](https://countrystatecity.in/docs/api/cities-by-country/ " Country State City API"): For retrieving country data and names. Learn more
- [GeoNames API](https://www.geonames.org "GeoNames API"): For fetching data about cities, villages, and more. Learn more
- [Aladhan API](https://aladhan.com/ "Aladhan API"): For prayer times data. Learn more

## Inspiration

The idea for this extension was inspired by another extension called [Adhan Time](https://www.raycast.com/mzaien/adhan-time "Adhan Time") by [mzaien](https://github.com/mzaien "mzaien").
