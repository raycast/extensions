# Bitwarden Extension

## Setup

1. Install the Bitwarden CLI: <https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/#download-and-install> (prefer the Homebrew method!)
2. Set your API secrets. For more information see <https://bitwarden.com/help/personal-api-key/#get-your-personal-api-key>

## Self-hosted Bitwarden Instance

This extension connects to Bitwarden-hosted servers by default, but can be configured to use a self-hosted Bitwarden instance instead. If the self-hosted Bitwarden server requires a self-signed TLS certificate, add the path to the extension preferences.
