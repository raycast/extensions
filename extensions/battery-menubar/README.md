# Battery status & power draw in your Menu Bar

Keep an eye on how quickly your battery is drained.

This extension adds a battery percentage icon to your menu bar that will change it's color when estimated time left on battery drops below a configurable amount, or when a lot of power is being used.

This way, you can quickly spot that you're using way too much power to survive through the day.

By clicking on the icon you can quickly check:

- how much battery is left - as a percentage and estimated time left,
- how much power has been drawn within last minute,
- how much more or less power you've used compared to 2 minutes ago - so you can see how much power is being used or saved when you change things - like dim your screen or kill Chrome,
- and how much the CPU was busy during that time.
