# Battery status & power draw in your Menu Bar

Keep an eye on how quickly your battery is drained.

This extension adds a battery percentage icon to your menu bar that will change it's color when estimated time left on battery drops below a configurable amount, or when a lot of power is being used.

This way, you can quickly spot that you're using way too much power to survive through the day.

By clicking on the icon you can quickly check:
