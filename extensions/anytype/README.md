## Tips

Make the most of the Anytype extension with the following tips:

- **Open**: Use <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to instantly open the currently selected space or object in Anytype.
- **Refresh**: Manually refresh data with <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>.
- **Deletion**: Quickly delete objects with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>.
- **Drafts**: Leave the Object Creation command with unsaved changes, and the current state is automatically saved as a draft, allowing you to resume later.
- **Quicklinks**: Leverage even faster object creation:
  - Select the `Space` and `Type`.
  - Prefill object fields as needed.
  - Use the `Create Quicklink` option in the action menu and save with <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
  - The Quicklink will appear in the root search under the specified name.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: API Not Reachable

- Ensure the Anytype Desktop app is running.
- Confirm you are logged into your vault.
- Verify both the extension and Anytype desktop app are up-to-date, with the app version being **v0.45.0** or later.

### Objects, Types or Spaces Not Displaying Completely

For performance reasons, the extension only fetches a limited amount of items at a time.

- Pagination is supported in lists to access additional items when scrolling down. However, the extension might refuse to paginate further if the available memory is exhausted.
- For dropdowns in `Create Object` command the limitation remains.
- The API limit can be adjusted in the extension settings - default is 50 items.
