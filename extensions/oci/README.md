# Oracle Cloud

This is a Raycast extension for [Oracle Cloud](https://cloud.oracle.com/). With this extension you can view **Core Services** (only Instances for now) and **VNIC Attachments**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install extension**: Click the `Install Extension` button in the top right of [this page](https://www.raycast.com/xmok/oci) OR `install` via Raycast Store

2. **Configure**:

    This extension uses the official SDK and needs configuration. Refer to [Developer Resources > Developer Guide > Setup and Prerequisites > SDK and CLI Configuration File](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm#SDK_and_CLI_Configuration_File) to learn where and how your configuration file needs to be set. Once done, the extension will work without further confguration needed.

    For the default method:
    
    - `Scroll` to the bottom of the page
    - `Copy` the "Example Configuration"
    - `Create` dir: `mkdir ~/.oci`
    - `Paste` the example contents into the config
    - `Update` the file with your own details

## 🗒️ Note

There are a lot of items in Oracle Cloud. PRs are welcome but due to the complexity of the SDK, it's recommended to open an Issue for discussion first.

## ❔

### **What's with the logo?**

Oracle has strict guidelines on usage of their Brand Assets so this is an alternative inspired by their Brand Colors. Feel free to make a PR if you have a better logo in mind 😅.
