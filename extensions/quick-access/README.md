# Quick Access

Pin directories you frequently visit, such as Downloads, Screenshot, Desktop and SaveFile directories.
Quickly access (copy, open, display) the latest files added to pinned directories.

This extension is equivalent to moving a folder to the Dock bar. Previously you had to use the mouse to access the folder in the Dock bar, now you can use Raycast to quickly access the pinned folder.
