# Contributing to Music extension
So you want to add some features to the **Music** extension right?
Awesome! Before contributing please be sure to read this document.

## Functional
This extension is written using `fp-ts` module.
If you're not familiar with it or with functional programming please read the documentation first (or just read the code first).
This is to aim to keep the code strongly typed and free from `uncaught exceptions`.

- Models available at `src/util/models.ts`

## Adding a new feature
All the `AppleScript` controls are in the `src/util/scripts` folder.
Each file represents some kind of macro-category.
If you want to add a new script please follow the project structure.
