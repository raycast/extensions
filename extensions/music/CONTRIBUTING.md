# Contributing to Music extension

So you want to add some features to the **Music** extension right?
Awesome! Before contributing please be sure to read this document.

## Functional

This extension is written using `fp-ts` module.
If you're not familiar with it or with functional programming please read the documentation first (or just read the code first).
This is to aim to keep the code strongly typed and free from `uncaught exceptions`.

- Models available at `src/util/models.ts`

## Adding a new feature

All the `AppleScript` controls are in the `src/util/scripts` folder.
Each file represents some kind of macro-category.
If you want to add a new script please follow the project structure.

> Every kind of contribution is welcome, but since every PR has to be tested and reviewed the scope and the size are crucial.
> Please try to avoid adding too many features at once. If this is the case, consider splitting your PR into multiple ones.
