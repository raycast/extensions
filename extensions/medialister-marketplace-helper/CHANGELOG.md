# Medialister Marketplace Helper Changelog

## [Flow Improvements] - 2025-01-19

- A new command, "Check Media for Placement Options," has been added to determine if a specific media can be booked on Medialister and at what cost. It also provides the Ahrefs Domain Rating for this media.
- Added a welcome screen mentioning that registration on Medialister is needed
- The form now has two fields. The first field saves your data locally, so you don't need to enter it every time
- A few changes to the prompt will help recognize requests like 'find good media' without specifics
