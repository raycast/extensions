## Set Up Extension

### Configure your Pipedrive Domain

As a Pipedrive customer, you should have a custom domain like `https://mycompany.pipedrive.com`. Enter the `mycompany.pipedrive.com` part in the extension's preference under `Domain`.

### Configure your Pipedrive API Token

Find your user's Pipedrive API token in your preferences on the Pipedrive website, then save it in the extension's preference under `API Token`.

If you need help finding your API token, Pipedrive has some documentation [here](https://support.pipedrive.com/en/article/how-can-i-find-my-personal-api-key).
