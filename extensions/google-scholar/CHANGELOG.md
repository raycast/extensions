- **Simplified architecture** - Removed complex bookmark management system
- **Streamlined interface** - Focus on core search functionality
- **Improved UX logic** - Year filtering disabled when sorting by newest (eliminates logical conflicts)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance
- **Terms of Service compliance** - No longer violates Google Scholar's ToS

### üéØ Why This Change?

**The Problem:** The previous version used web scraping to extract search results from Google Scholar, which:
- Violated Google Scholar's Terms of Service
- Was blocked by Google's anti-scraping measures
- Required constant maintenance due to HTML structure changes

- Provided an unreliable user experience

**The Solution:** This version takes a compliance-first approach:
- Uses Google Scholar's official search parameters
- Opens results in the user's browser for full functionality
- Respects Google's intended usage patterns
- Provides a sustainable, future-proof solution
- Maintains excellent usability while ensuring compliance

### üîÑ Migration Notes

**For users upgrading from v1.0:**
- Previous bookmarks and saved articles are no longer accessible
- Search functionality is now browser-based instead of in-app
- Recent search history will be reset
- No data migration is possible due to architectural changes

**Recommended workflow:**
1. Use the extension to construct advanced searches
2. Review results in Google Scholar (full features available)
3. Bookmark articles using your browser's bookmark system
4. Use Google Scholar's "My Library" for research management
