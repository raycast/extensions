### Note on Rate Limiting

This extension makes requests directly to Google Scholar. While it includes features like User-Agent rotation and retries on rate limit errors (like HTTP 429), excessively frequent or rapid searches may lead to temporary blocking or CAPTCHA challenges from Google Scholar. The extension aims to handle these gracefully by informing the user.
