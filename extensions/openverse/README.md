# Openverse &times; Raycast

Openverse is a powerful search engine for GPL-compatible images, audio, and
more. Openverse is live at [openverse.org](https://openverse.org).

This extension provides a way to search for Openverse images inside Raycast,
browse through the top results, find a suitable image, obtain a copy of it and
get attribution information, all with just a few keystrokes.

> **Note:** This extension only supports images at the moment. Support for
> audio _might_ be considered in the future. No promises.
