# AI Code Namer - Raycast Extension

AI Code Namer is a Raycast extension that leverages AI to help developers generate clear, descriptive, and context-appropriate names for various code elements such as variables, functions, classes, files, folders, modules, and enums.

## Features

- Generate names for different code elements (variables, functions, classes, files, folders, modules, enums)
- Support for multiple naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, kebab-case, UPPER_CASE)
- AI-powered suggestions based on your description
- Quick copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Remembers your last used naming style for each code element type

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [Raycast](https://raycast.com/) installed.
2. Open Raycast and search for "AI Code Namer".
3. Click "Install" to add the extension to your Raycast.

## Usage

1. Open Raycast and type "Name [Element]" (e.g., "Name Variable", "Name Function").
2. Enter a description for your code element in the search bar.
3. (Optional) Change the naming style using the dropdown in the top-right corner. The extension will remember your choice for future use with this code element type.
4. Press Enter or click "Generate Names" to get AI-generated suggestions.
5. Select a name from the list and press Enter to copy it to your clipboard.

Note: The extension remembers your last used naming style for each code element type. When you use the command again for the same element type, it will default to your previously selected style.
