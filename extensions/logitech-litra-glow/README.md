# Logitech Litra Glow extension for Raycast

This [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) extension allows you to turn your [Logitech Litra Glow](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/lighting/litra-glow.946-000002.html) light on and off from Raycast.

It's powered by my [`litra-glow`](https://github.com/timrogers/litra-glow) npm package.
