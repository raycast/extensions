2. Click **Create an API Application** to request permission to use the API.

3. Provide details for your application. Depending on your needs, your application may require staff approval.

4. Once your application is approved, esv.org will provide you an API key. (Note: treat your API key like a password.)

5. If you need access to your API key in the future, you can find it by logging in, clicking the avatar, and choosing **My API Applications**. All your approved applications should show in the list.
