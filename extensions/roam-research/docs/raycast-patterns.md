# Raycast Patterns

Non-obvious Raycast extension patterns used in this codebase. This is not a Raycast tutorial — it covers the specific patterns that differ from standard React web development and would trip up an LLM agent or contributor unfamiliar with the framework.

**Source files:** All `src/*.tsx` entry points, `utils.ts`, `components.tsx`

---

## 1. View vs No-View Commands

Raycast commands come in two modes, declared in `package.json`:

- **`"mode": "view"`** — Exports a React component. Has access to hooks, JSX, and the full Raycast UI. Example: `quick-capture.tsx` renders template/graph selection lists and pushes to `QuickCaptureForm`.
- **`"mode": "no-view"`** — Exports an `async function`. Runs headlessly — no React, no hooks, no JSX. Communicates via `showHUD()` or `showToast()` only. Example: `instant-capture-default-graph.tsx` reads config, calls the API, and shows a HUD.

> **Key constraint:** You cannot use `useLocalStorage`, `useCachedPromise`, `useNavigation`, or any React hook in a no-view command. Use `LocalStorage.getItem()` directly and plain functions like `resolveInstantCapture()`.

## 2. Storage: Cache vs LocalStorage

Four storage mechanisms, each with different security and lifecycle:

| Storage                | Security     | Persistence                                                      | Use for                                   | API                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Cache`                | Insecure LRU | Ephemeral (survives restarts, but evicted under memory pressure) | Page lists (2hr TTL), used pages (MRU)    | `new Cache({ namespace })` — sync get/set                |
| `LocalStorage`         | Encrypted    | Persistent                                                       | Graph tokens, configs, templates          | `LocalStorage.getItem/setItem()` — async                 |
| `useLocalStorage` hook | Encrypted    | Persistent                                                       | Same as above, but reactive in components | `useLocalStorage(key)` from `@raycast/utils`             |
| `useCachedPromise`     | In-memory    | Per-session (lost on command exit)                               | Search results, async fetched data        | `useCachedPromise(fn, args, opts)` from `@raycast/utils` |

**Rule of thumb:** Sensitive data (API tokens, graph configs) → `LocalStorage`. Ephemeral caches (page lists, peer URLs) → `Cache`. Async data in components → `useCachedPromise`.

> **Never put tokens in `Cache`** — it's unencrypted and readable by other extensions.

## 3. Navigation Stack

Raycast uses a stack-based navigation model (like iOS), not URL-based routing:

- `useNavigation()` returns `{ push, pop }` — `push()` adds a view on top, `pop()` removes it
- Pressing **Escape** pops the current view (goes back)
- `Action.Push` in an `ActionPanel` navigates to a new view when the action is triggered
- After form submission, call `pop()` to return to the previous screen (e.g., list view)

This extension's common pattern: List view → `Action.Push` to detail/form view → `pop()` on success.

---

## 4. Form Validation

Raycast forms do **not** prevent submission on validation errors — unlike HTML forms:

- The `error` prop on `Form.TextField` shows red text, but it's purely cosmetic
- You must check validation in the `onSubmit` handler and `return` early if invalid
- Use `onBlur` callbacks for per-field validation as the user moves between fields
- Use `onChange` callbacks to clear errors when the user starts correcting input

See `new-graph.tsx` for the full pattern (blur validation + submit-time checking).

---

## 5. Arguments vs Preferences

Two ways to pass data to commands, easily confused:

|                  | Arguments                                | Preferences                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Declared in**  | `package.json` → command's `arguments[]` | `package.json` → `preferences[]`          |
| **Scope**        | Per-invocation (user types each time)    | Persistent (set once in Raycast Settings) |
| **Accessed via** | `props.arguments` from `LaunchProps`     | `getPreferenceValues<Preferences>()`      |
| **Works in**     | Both view and no-view                    | Both view and no-view                     |
| **Example**      | `text` argument in Quick Capture         | `openIn` preference (web vs desktop app)  |

---

## 6. Hooks vs Pure Functions

Hooks only work in `view` commands (React components). For logic shared between view and no-view commands, extract pure functions:

| Context                          | Can use hooks? | Config access pattern                                           |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| View command (React component)   | Yes            | `useGraphsConfig()` hook → reactive state                       |
| No-view command (async function) | No             | `LocalStorage.getItem("graphs-config")` → parse JSON            |
| Shared logic                     | —              | Pure functions: `resolveInstantCapture()`, `getFirstTemplate()` |

`getPreferenceValues()` works everywhere — it's not a hook despite the function naming convention.

---

## 7. Inter-Command Communication

Commands can launch other commands programmatically:

```typescript
import { launchCommand, LaunchType } from "@raycast/api";

await launchCommand({ name: "manage-templates", type: LaunchType.UserInitiated });
```

Used in `components.tsx → QuickCaptureForm` to open the "Manage Templates" command from a menu action. The launched command opens as if the user triggered it directly from Raycast.
