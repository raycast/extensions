# Timecamp

## What You'll Need
You will need to get your Timecamp API token. You can find this token at [here](https://app.timecamp.com/app#/settings/users/me), usually under the subheading `Your programming API token:`.

## Commands
### Start/Stop Tasks
This command finds all the tasks that have no more children and lists them. You can press `ENTER` to start a task. You'll see this task with it's timer under a new `Active Tasks` section at the top of the list. If you start another task while one is active, it will end the active task and start the new one.

When hovering the active task, you can hit `CMD + S` to end the task or `ENTER` to edit the task note. When editing the task note, hitting `CMD + ENTER` will save the note and bring you back to the task list.
