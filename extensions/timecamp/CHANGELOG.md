# TimeCamp Changelog

## [Update] - 2024-01-31 
- Add Frecency sorting to the task list. The tasks will show as the most used closer to the top.
- On the `Recent Tasks` section of the task list, removed duplicated tasks if the note/description is the same. That way if you are changing between the same two tasks with the same note, they won't take up more than one space in the list, leaving room for other recent tasks.

## [Initial Version] - 2024-01-15
