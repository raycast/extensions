/**
 * Custom hook for managing the list of Atomberg devices
 *
 * This hook provides device listing functionality with intelligent caching
 * and background management. It's optimized for device lists that don't
 * change frequently but need to be kept up-to-date.
 *
 * @param preferences - User preferences containing API credentials
 * @returns React Query result object with devices list data and state
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Only enabled when API credentials are provided
 * - Devices list is cached for 5 minutes (doesn't change often)
 * - Garbage collection occurs after 15 minutes of inactivity
 * - Does not refetch on window focus to reduce unnecessary API calls
 * - Optimized for static device lists with occasional updates
