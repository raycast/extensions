## Limitations

- Unfortunately, there is currently no way of automatically exporting the secrets from the Proton Authenticator app. Instead, you need to export the secrets yourself as a JSON file and upload the JSON file in the extension. This is only a one-time setup, but if you added new secrets to the Proton Authenticator app, then you need to repeat this step again.

## Setup

1. Export your authenticator data from Proton Pass
2. Upload the JSON file to the tool as prompted
