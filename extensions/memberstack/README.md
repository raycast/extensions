# Memberstack

This is a Raycast extension for [Memberstack](https://www.memberstack.com/).

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install extension**: Click the `Install Extension` button in the top right of [this page](https://www.raycast.com/xmok/memberstack) OR `install` via Raycast Store

2. **Get your Secret Key**: The first time you use the extension, you'll need to enter your 'Secret' API Key:

    a. `Sign in` to your Account at [this link](https://app.memberstack.com/login) (this is using Memberstack Dashboard 2.0)

    (if you don't have an account, `Sign up` at [this link](https://app.memberstack.com/signup))

    b. `Navigate` to "Dev Tools" (the link should be in the left navbar)

    c. `Copy` the "Secret Key"
  
    d. `Enter` this key in Preferences OR at first prompt

## 🗒️ NOTE

The extension has the following missing features (these will likely be implemented in the future [PRs are welcome]):

- Can only specify "email" and "password" when `Create` (i.e. can not add custom fields, assign a custom plan, etc.)
- Can only `Edit` "email" and "verified" (i.e. no custom fields, plans, etc.)
