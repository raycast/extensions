# Proxmox Virtual Environment

## Caveats

- This extension was tested on `PVE > 8.1` and may not work on earlier releases.

## About

Interact with [Proxmox Virtual Environment](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview).  
View `Nodes`, `Storage`, `Linux Containers (LXC)`, and `Nodes` present in a Proxmox instance.

## Potential Improvements ("TODO")

- Generate Console link/URI
- Allow performing power actions on LXC containers
- Fetch more in-depth information for individual resources
- Additional commands for viewing and managing various Proxmox resources, such as:
  - Cluster
  - Networking (SDN, IPAM, Zones, VNets)
  - ACME
  - Firewall
  - Ceph
  - Resource Pools
