# Apple Maps Search

## Setup

1. Enter your home address in Raycast preferences. It will be used to quickly pull up directions to your home.
2. Select your preferred mode of travel. This will be the default for all searches.
3. For full functionality you should allow [Apple Maps](https://www.apple.com/maps) to access your location in your preferred browser. This way `Travel Home` and `Travel To` will immediately pull up directions starting from your current location.

## Searching

Use the extension's search fields as you would use the ones on Apple Maps. They can take regular addresses, as well as building names.

## Privacy

This extension only stores your address locally to pass it to the Apple Maps API. This extension does nothing else with your info.

## Acknowledgements

This extension is based on a fork of the [Google Maps Search extension](https://www.raycast.com/ratoru/google-maps-search).
