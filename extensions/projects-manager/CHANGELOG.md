## Taskmaster integration

In this release, I've added Taskmaster Integration - an AI-powered project management tool. When creating a new project, you can now provide a description which will automatically generate a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD). The PRD is saved in `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt` and can be used with Taskmaster to break down the project into manageable tasks.

Key features:
- AI-generated PRD from project description
- Automatic creation of `.taskmaster` folder structure 
- Integration with Taskmaster task management
