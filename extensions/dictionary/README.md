# Web Dictionaries

Search any word with multiple online dictionaries or translation engines in one place—lightweight, zero dependencies.

## Features

The extension is powerful and lightweight with no dependencies. It is built with the official Raycast [API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@raycast/api) and [utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@raycast/utils).

Search across multiple online dictionaries and translation engines, currently including:
- Google Translation
- Urban Dictionary
- Google Cloud Translation API (`Google API key` required)
- Youdao API (`Youdao Client ID` and `Youdao Secret` required)

It provides the command `Search from Cursor Selection` to quickly look up your currently selected words. Feel free to bind a hotkey, such as double <kbd>⌘ cmd</kbd>, for quick access.

View related definitions and example sentences when available. It also supports auto reverse (fallback) search, whenever the detected input matches the default language.

Access TTS (Text-to-Speech) for the following engines:
- Google Translation
- Youdao

As a bonus, you can configure this extension directly from the command line in an old-fashioned way!
