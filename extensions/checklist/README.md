# Checklist

> Create and work on checklists.

**Checklist** is a simple - _Raycast native_ - app that allows you to create and work on checklists. Based on [The Checklist Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto) you know checklists can save lives and make you more productive by improving the quality of repetitive tasks. **Checklist** lets you create, edit and delete checklists. You can easily start working on them and keep track of the progress.

## How it works

1. Call `Show Checklists`.
2. Add a Checklist by pressing `CMD+N`.
3. Give it a name and press `CMD+N'` to add tasks. Finally add the checklist by pressing `CMD+Enter`.
4. Now select the Checklist and press `Enter` to start working on it. Check off tasks by pressing `Enter`.
5. Once you're done with a Checklist, export a markdown report by pressing `CMD+T` â†’ `Export Markdown`.

## Import & Export Checklists

You can easily share your checklists with others by exporting them with `CMD+.`. This will copy a stringified JSON to you clipboard. You can also import checklists from others by having a valid stringified checklist definition in your clipboard during checklist creation.
