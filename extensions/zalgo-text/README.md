# Raycast Extension: Zalgo Text Generator

This Raycast extension allows you to easily generate Zalgo text from a given string of text.

## What is Zalgo Text?

Zalgo text is a type of text that is characterized by its use of combining characters, diacritical marks, and other symbols to create an effect that is reminiscent of glitched or corrupted text. Zalgo text is often used for aesthetic purposes in internet memes, horror-themed content, and other creative works.

The term "Zalgo" comes from a character of the same name from a webcomic series called "Ctrl+Alt+Del". The character is portrayed as a demonic entity that corrupts and distorts everything it comes into contact with, including text.

Zalgo text can be created by adding various combining characters and diacritical marks to each character in a given string of text. These marks can be stacked and combined in different ways to create unique Zalgo text effects.

## Installation

1. Install [Raycast](https://raycast.com/) on your Mac.
2. Download and install the Zalgo Text Generator extension.
3. Open Raycast and type `zalgo` to use the extension.

## Usage

To generate Zalgo text using the extension, follow these steps:

1. Open Raycast.
2. Type `/zalgo` followed by the text you want to convert to Zalgo text.
3. Press enter to generate the Zalgo text.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Zalgo Text Generator extension:

```
zalgo Hello, world!
```

This will generate the following Zalgo text:

```
H̴̲̋̄͗̇e̴̢̯̪̓̃͂͠l̴̼̬̞̃̊̕l̵̖͆̓̄́ỏ̴̢͙̯͂̿̄,̷̭͔̩̠̎͠͝͝ ̶̨̼̣́̑͊̚ẁ̵̖̝̲͆ō̷̡̥̳͌͗̾r̵̭̤̈́̊͠͝l̷̢̞̉͒͑d̷̢͚̅̂͆͠!̶̧̝͝
```

## How it Works

The Zalgo Text Generator extension uses the `to-zalgo` module to convert a given string of text to Zalgo text. The `to-zalgo` module adds Zalgo text characters to each character in the input string, resulting in the final Zalgo text output.
