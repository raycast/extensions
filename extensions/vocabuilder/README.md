# VocaBuilder

A [Raycast](https://raycast.com) extension that translates words and short text between languages via the Gemini AI API and saves a local translation history — helping you build vocabulary over time.

## Features

- **Translate words and text** — translate a single word with part of speech and example sentences, or translate short text directly
- **Multi-sense word translations** — for ambiguous words, review up to 5 senses and save the one you want to keep
- **Typo correction** — misspelled word input is auto-corrected before translating, with a visual indicator showing the original input
- **Translation History** — browse, search, and manage all your saved translations
- **Flashcards** — review saved word translations with spaced repetition
- **Configurable language pair** — pick source and target from 17 supported languages (defaults to English → Ukrainian)
- **Separate history per language pair** — switching languages gives you an independent history and flashcard deck
- **Clipboard suggestion** — optionally prefill a safe single word from the clipboard when the command opens
- **History export** — export saved history as JSON, Anki-ready TSV, or Quizlet-ready TSV
- Saves accepted translations to local history automatically
- Debounced word translation, with manual submit for text input
- Graceful error handling for API issues
