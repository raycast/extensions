# Reading Time Calculator

A Raycast extension that helps you calculate how long it would take to read text out loud. Perfect for preparing presentations, speeches, or estimating reading time for articles.

## Features

- üî¢ Shows word count statistics
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast and efficient calculations
- ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable reading speed (Words Per Minute)

## Usage

1. Copy any text you want to analyze
2. Open Raycast
3. Type "reading time"
4. Press Enter
5. Paste the text

The extension can:

- Read text from your clipboard
- Calculate the reading time
- Display:
  - The original text
  - Estimated reading time
  - Total word count
  - Your current reading speed (WPM)

## Configuration

You can customize your reading speed in the extension preferences:

1. Open Raycast
2. Go to Extensions
3. Find "Reading Time Calculator"
4. Adjust the "Reading Speed" setting (default: 130 WPM)

## How it Works

The extension uses a standard words-per-minute (WPM) calculation to estimate reading time. The default reading speed is set to 130 WPM, which is considered an average speaking pace for presentations. You can adjust this value based on your personal reading or speaking speed.

## Tips

- For presentations: Use a lower WPM (around 100-130) to account for pauses and emphasis
- For silent reading: You might want to set a higher WPM (around 200-250)
- For technical content: Consider using a lower WPM as technical terms often require more time to articulate
