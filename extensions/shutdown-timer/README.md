# Timed Controlled Shutdown for Raycast

A Raycast extension that allows users to schedule a controlled shutdown for their system, ensuring tasks can complete before powering down. I made this because I wanted to simplify scheduling shutdowns so that I didn't need to have an extra terminal window to manage it

## Features

- Set a custom timer for shutdown (minutes or hours)
- View remaining time before shutdown
- Works seamlessly within Raycast

## Usage

1. Schedule the shutdown using _Schedule Shutdown_

2. Fill out the timer details `
<minute> minutes <second> seconds`

- You can use min or sec as well.
- Set only minutes or set only seconds

3. See remaining time using _Remaining Time_

4. Cancel Shutdown using _Stop Shutdown_
