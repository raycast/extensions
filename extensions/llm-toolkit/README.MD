Access LLMs on any API that conforms to the OpenAI API spec via raycast. Eg groq, perplexity, mistral, etc.

For example, you can obtain an API key for groq here: https://console.groq.com.

This extension's code is largely based upon [maximilianzuern](https://github.com/maximilianzuern)'s [perplexity extension](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/perplexity-api), kudos to him for his excellent work.
