This is a simple extension for Raycast that will help you calculate the best time to sleep or wake up.

### How does this work?

Have you ever experienced waking up in the morning feeling drowsy and not fully rested despite having slept well? Perhaps you've concluded that you're simply not at your best in the mornings?

If the above scenario resonates with you, you might be experiencing the effects of sleep inertia. This is a common phenomenon that impacts as many as 9 out of 10 individuals who wake up to an alarm clock.

You can determine either the ideal bedtime if you know when you need to wake up, or the optimal wake-up time if you know when you plan to go to bed.

A sleep cycle denotes a repetitive 90-minute period during which the body experiences distinct sleep stages. These stages are grouped into four phases, with the initial two considered as light sleep, and the latter two as deep sleep.

**Phases of the Cycle:**

- N1 (Onset of light sleep)
- N2 (Light sleep)
- N3 (Deep Sleep)
- REM (Rapid Eye Movement, characterized by vivid dreaming)

Typically, you'll feel most revitalized if you awaken during the lighter phases of sleep. Awakening during a deeper phase increases the likelihood of feeling drowsy and not fully rested.
