# Ray Clicker Changelog

## [Fix: Idle Accrual Sync & Prestige fix & UX improvements] - {PR_MERGE_DATE}

- Sync main UI state from storage when the menu bar heartbeat is active to reflect idle gains without double-counting (`src/useGameState.ts`).
- Convert menu bar command to a continuous 1s accrual loop; maintain heartbeat, persist each tick, and clean up on unmount (`src/menu-bar.tsx`).
- Add visible "Prestige Now" action and require explicit `GameView` props (remove placeholder overrides) for clarity and top-level correctness (`src/GameView.tsx`).
- Rebalance: Reduce `PRESTIGE_PP_DIVISOR` from 800,000 to 500,000 for faster early prestige (`src/constants.ts`).
- fix: changed wording on some upgrades to make them fit the space better
- fix: prestige upgrade purchase to not update state if it fails
- fix: readded missing prestige upgrade purchase button
- fix: prestige duplication glitch
- fix: idle rate not updating
- add way for user to see how achievement was unlocked
 - fix: ensure initial Menu Bar UI updates when previous UI state is null (avoid self-compare) (`src/menu-bar.tsx`)
 - refactor: centralize prestige points calculation via `calculatePrestigePoints()` and replace duplicates (`src/utils.ts`, `src/index.tsx`, `src/PrestigeView.tsx`, `src/useGameState.ts`)
 - chore: Title-case Menu Bar command title in `package.json` (reviewer-preferred casing)
