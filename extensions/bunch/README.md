**Bunch**: Your new favorite Mac automation tool

> Bunch is a macOS automation tool that takes a folder of plain text files containing lists of apps and commands to launch and provides an easy-to-use menu for triggering them.
>
> Its intuitive syntax makes it easy to get started, and its array of features allows you to automate everything you need to work smarter and faster. Build “contexts” of apps and settings for your different modes of work and play, and switch between them with a couple of keystrokes.
>
> It’s just plain text, but with Bunch it’s a powerful automation tool. I think you’ll like it. [Learn more](https://bunchapp.co/docs/).
