# DirectAdmin [Reseller] Raycast Extension

This is a Raycast extension for [DirectAdmin](https://www.directadmin.com/) Reseller level accounts. With this extension you can manage Reseller User Accounts, User Domains and Subdomains, User Email Accounts, User Status (Suspend or Unsuspend), and manage your own user databases, domains and subdomains.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install extension**: Click the `Install Extension` button in the top right of [this page](https://www.raycast.com/xmok/directadmin-reseller) OR via Raycast Store

2. **Enter your DirectAdmin Details**: The first time you use the extension, you'll need to enter the following in Preferences OR at first prompt:

    a. The URL of your DirectAdmin instance (w/ Port)

    b. Reseller Username

    c. Reseller Password

## 🗒️ Notes

- This extension is for ****Reseller**** level accounts but you can also manage your own "user" level account (i.e. a ****User****) through the `My Domains` and `My Databases` commands - the other commands will not work as you need to be a **Reseller**.

- On a Technical Note, some "user" commands have dedicated DirectAdmin endpoints but for those which do not, a **Reseller** can `impersonate` a user through the API.
