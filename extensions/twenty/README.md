## üìò User Guide

To use the extension, search for the `Create Object Record` command, which will display all your `active` standard and custom objects currently in your twentyCRM. Its very flexible - if you create new objects or deactivate existing ones, this will automatically reflect those changes.

When you deactivate any standard or custom object, it will no longer appear, ensuring you only see the information and objects you want to access. This makes the extension extensible and enhances your productivity.

If you create new custom objects, they will appear, allowing you to quickly create your records instantly from Raycast.

To create a record for any object, select your target object and press `ENTER`. This will open a form that matches the exact table schema you created in your CRM, following any validations it suggests to successfully create your record by pressing `CMD + ENTER`. Records cannot be created with an empty first column (such as Name, Title, etc.).

Similar to creation of standard object record you can create custom objects record

If you want to create multiple records for the same object without closing the form after each one, go to the Raycast command settings and check the option to `keep object form open after record creation`.

It's much more flexible‚Äîsimilar to objects, if you deactivate any fields, they will no longer appear in your object schema during record creation.

No worries! If you add or update any fields in your standard objects, they will automatically appear in your object schema form in Raycast, looking closely you will see, if you add a select field with a default value provided some icon, it will display exactly what you‚Äôve set when creation.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

- [x] Currently we support `FULL_NAME`, `TEXT`, `LINKS`, `EMAILS`, `SELECT`.
- [x] Supporting other fields are easy as we have build the foundation and its quite similar to what we have already build.
- [ ] PHONE_NUMBER, CURRENCY similar to LINKS
- [ ] RATING (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as option), BOOLEAN (True or False as option), MULTI_SELECT are similar to SELECT
- [ ] RELATION Similar to SELECT but requires additional work but doable
- [ ] support seeing records of all objects
