# Ethereum Price

## [Update] - 2022-10-05

- Added INR in the list of currencies
- Added "Compact Mode" in Preferences. It updates the UI to take up less space in the Menu Bar, by:
  - Hiding the Icon
  - Replacing "ETH" with the Eth Symbol "Îž"
  - Using a more compact currency formatting. Eg: $1.35k instead of $1,355
- "Compact Mode" is on by default
- Regardless of the mode, fractional digits are no longer shown. Eg: $1,355 instead of $1,355.99
- Removed "Hide Icon" in Preferences in favour of the new "Compact Mode".

## [Update] - 2022-09-28

You can now click on a Menu Item to set it as the shown currency in the Menu Bar.
