# Jira

Create, access and modify issues and sprints.

## Logging in with an API token

The Jira extension supports OAuth authentication by default. But if you want, you can log in with an API token instead. To do so, you must:

1. Get an API token as described [here](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/).
2. Select any command from the Jira extension, then press `âŒ˜` + `K` and scroll down to `Configure Extension`. Enter your email, API token, and Jira site URL (without `https://`) on the right. Note that all three must be provided to use API tokens.
