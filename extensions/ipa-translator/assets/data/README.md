# Dictionary data

The original data is in txt format. Convert it to JSON using the `convert.py`
file in the `script` directory. Don't directly modify the JSON output, but
modify the txt files (if needed) and let the script convert it to json.

## Important note

Do **NOT** edit any of the files in this directory manually. Edit them in
`original-data/FILENAME.txt` and convert them using the python convertion
script found in `script/convert.py`.
