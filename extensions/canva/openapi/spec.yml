Supported file types for assets are listed in the [Assets API overview](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/assets/).

        The request format for this endpoint is an `application/octet-stream` body of bytes. Attach
        information about the upload using an `Asset-Upload-Metadata` header.

        Later this year, we'll be updating all brand template IDs. If your integration stores brand template IDs, you'll need to migrate to the new IDs. Once we implement this change, you'll have 6 months to update the IDs.

        </Warning>

        <Note>

        To use this API, your integration must act on behalf of a user that's a member of a [Canva Enterprise](https://www.canva.com/enterprise/) organization.

        </Note>

        Starts a new [asynchronous job](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-requests-responses/#asynchronous-job-endpoints) to autofill a Canva design using a brand template and input data.

        To get a list of input data fields, use the [Get brand template dataset
        API](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/brand-templates/get-brand-template-dataset/).

        Available data field types to autofill include:

        - Images
        - Text
        - Charts

          WARNING: Chart data fields are a [preview feature](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/#preview-apis). There might be unannounced breaking changes to this feature which won't produce a new API version.

        Gets the dataset definition of a brand template. If the brand
        template contains autofill data fields, this API returns an object with the data field
        names and the type of data they accept.

        Available data field types include:

        - Images
        - Text
        - Charts

        You can autofill a brand template using the [Create a design autofill job
        API](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/autofills/create-design-autofill-job/).

        WARNING: Chart data fields are a [preview feature](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/#preview-apis). There might be unannounced breaking changes to this feature which won't produce a new API version.

        </Warning>

        The Keys API (`connect/keys`) is a security measure you can use to verify the authenticity
        of webhooks you receive from Canva Connect. The Keys API returns a
        [JSON Web Key (JWK)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517#section-2), which you can use to
        decrypt the webhook signature and verify it came from Canva and not a potentially malicious
        actor. This helps to protect your systems from
        [Replay attacks](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/).

        The keys returned by the Keys API can rotate. We recommend you cache the keys you receive
        from this API where possible, and only access this API when you receive a webhook signed
        with an unrecognized key. This allows you to verify webhooks quicker than accessing this API
        every time you receive a webhook.

        Starts a new [asynchronous job](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-requests-responses/#asynchronous-job-endpoints) to import an external file as a new design in Canva.

        The request format for this endpoint has an `application/octet-stream` body of bytes,
        and the information about the import is provided using an `Import-Metadata` header.

        Supported file types for imports are listed in [Design imports overview](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/design-imports/#supported-file-types).

        <Note>

You can check the status and get the results of design import jobs created with this API using the [Get design import job API](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/design-imports/get-design-import-job/).

        Moves an item to another folder. You must specify the folder ID of the destination folder, as well as the ID of the item you want to move.

        NOTE: In some situations, a single item can exist in multiple folders. If you attempt to move an item that exists in multiple folders, the API returns an `item_in_multiple_folders` error. In this case, you must use the Canva UI to move the item to another folder.

        This endpoint implements the OAuth 2.0 `token` endpoint, as part of the Authorization Code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). For more information, see [Authentication](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/authentication/).

        To generate an access token, you must provide one of the following:

        - An authorization code
        - A refresh token

        Generating a token using either an authorization code or a refresh token allows your integration to act on behalf of a user. You must first [obtain user authorization and get an authorization code](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/authentication/#obtain-user-authorization).

        Access tokens may be up to 4 KB in size, and are only valid for a specified period of time. The expiry time (currently 4 hours) is shown in the endpoint response and is subject to change.

        **Endpoint authentication**

        Requests to this endpoint require authentication with your client ID and client secret, using _one_ of the following methods:

        - **Basic access authentication** (Recommended): For [basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), the `{credentials}` string must be a Base64 encoded value of `{client id}:{client secret}`.
        - **Body parameters**: Provide your integration's credentials using the `client_id` and `client_secret` body parameters.

        This endpoint can't be called from a user's web-browser client because it uses client authentication with client secrets. Requests must come from your integration's backend, otherwise they'll be blocked by Canva's [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) policy.

        **Generate an access token using an authorization code**

        To generate an access token with an authorization code, you must:

        - Set `grant_type` to `authorization_code`.
        - Provide the `code_verifier` value that you generated when creating the user authorization URL.
        - Provide the authorization code you received after the user authorized the integration.

        **Generate an access token using a refresh token**

        Using the `refresh_token` value from a previous user token request, you can get a new access token with the same or smaller scope as the previous one, but with a refreshed expiry time. You will also receive a new refresh token that you can use to refresh the access token again.

        To refresh an existing access token, you must:

        - Set `grant_type` to `refresh_token`.
        - Provide the `refresh_token` from a previous token request.

        Revoke an access token or a refresh token.

        If you revoke a _refresh token_, be aware that:

        - The refresh token's lineage is also revoked. This means that access tokens created from that refresh token are also revoked.
        - The user's consent for your integration is also revoked. This means that the user must go through the OAuth process again to use your integration.

        Requests to this endpoint require authentication with your client ID and client secret, using _one_ of the following methods:
