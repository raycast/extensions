# Ask AI

Craft and refine prompts that perfectly suit your needs.

## Getting Started

For the simplest setup, keep the default settings and add a `Secret Key` from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys). OpenRouter provides access to various AI models, including GPT-4 and Claude 3.

> Your `Secret Key` is stored locally using the [Preferences API](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/preferences), ensuring it remains secure.

## Special Thanks

Ask AI is built upon the foundation of the original [ChatGPT extension](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/chatgpt). We extend our gratitude to [Iran Garcia](irangarcia.co) for their work.
