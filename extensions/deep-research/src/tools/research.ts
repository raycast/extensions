These are your required parameters. Pass them in as a object with the following properties:
- thought: string
  - Your current thinking step, such as analytical steps, questions about previous decisions, realizations about needing more analysis, changes in approach, hypothesis generation, hypothesis verification
- nextThoughtNeeded: boolean
  - Whether another thought step is needed; True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thoughtNumber: number
  - Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- totalThoughts: number
  - Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- goals: string[]
  - What the user wishes to achieve as a "large picture", be as specific as possible
- learnings: string[]
  - All the learnings you have made at every step. You should only add to these learnings, not remove existing ones. You should use these learnings to inform your next steps
- questions: string[]
  - All the questions you want to investigate at every step. You should refine these questions, changing them as you progress in your research
- id: string
  - A unique identifier for the thought process. This is used to store the thought process in a file. It should be unique to the thought process you are working on
