# GitHub Codespaces for Raycast

Display, launch, and manage your codespaces from Raycast

## Setup

This extension requires the creation of a personal access token to work. To get started, first:

- Login to GitHub.com
- Click on your avatar image in the right upper corner
- From the dropdown menu, click on `Settings`
- On the left-hand side, click on `Developer settings`.
- On the left-hand side, click on `Personal access tokens`.
- On this page, we'll create a new access token. Click on `Generate new token` in the upper-right.
- Leave a `note` for your token (Eg. `GitHub Codespaces for Raycast`). This will help you identify it in the future.
- You'll need to check the following boxes to ensure this extension can perform properly:
  - `repo`
  - `codespaces`
- Click `Generate token` and save this value somewhere. **You'll only be able to see this once**.
- **When you run this extension for the first time, you'll be prompted to enter this token.**
