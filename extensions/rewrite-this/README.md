# Rewrite This

Rewrite This is a Raycast extension that instantly rewrites any text using Anthropic's Claude AI. Simply copy text to your clipboard, run the extension, and get back polished, well-written content in seconds.

## Why Use Rewrite This?

**Eliminate frustrating context switching** - No more copying text, switching to ChatGPT or Claude's website, waiting for it to load, pasting your text, writing a prompt, copying the result, and switching back to your original app.

With Rewrite This, you can:
- Stay in your current application (email, document, browser, wherever)
- Use a simple hotkey (we recommend setting up OPTION + R)
- Get your rewritten text instantly copied back to your clipboard

This workflow saves you time and mental energy, letting you focus on your work without interruption.

## Security & Privacy
