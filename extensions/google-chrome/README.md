# Google Chrome Extension

- Open new tabs in Google Chrome
- Search and jump to currently open tabs in Google Chrome Browser
- Search and open Google Chrome tabs from search query based on browser history across all profiles
- Search and open Google Chrome tabs from search query based on bookmarks across all profiles
- Close tabs
- Create new window in Google Chrome

_Note_:

Open profile support is limited to opening tab in new profile window. You can customize default tab opening behaviour in settings.

If you are using `Default` mode and have multiple profiles open in parallel, the tab will open in the topmost window.

These are due to limitations in the Chrome API.
