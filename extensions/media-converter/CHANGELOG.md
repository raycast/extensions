# Media Converter Changelog

## [1.3.0] - 2025-05-27

### Added

- Support for .jpeg, .tif, .bmp files as input (not to be mistaken with .jpg and .tiff which were already supported)
- Quality options for all image formats

### Removed

- Quick Convert
  - Now replaced by the main "Convert Media" command
  - Since Convert Media now auto-selects the selected Finder files, no need for the Quick Convert action anymore
  - The main "Convert Media" command is just as fast as was "Quick Convert". If you don't know what quality setting to choose, defaults are good.

### Fixed

- Converting from and to .heic now works from and to any formats.

### API Changes

- Rewrote nearly the whole extension
  - Centralised convert-media.ts tool
  - Centralised types in converter.ts
  - Rewrote the file handling logic in ConverterForm.tsx
  - Added quality handling logic for images
  - Many more. See pull request for more info.
