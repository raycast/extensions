## [Added Read Image Feature] - 2023-01-29

We have introduced a new feature called "Read Image" to our application. This feature allows users to extract text from selected images. Here's how it works:

1. Users can select an image from their device or provide a URL to an image.
2. The application validates the image to ensure it is in a supported format (JPEG, PNG, or WEBP) and accessible via a valid URL.
3. Once the image is validated, the application uses advanced AI technology to process the image and extract the text content.
4. The extracted text is then made available to the user for further use or analysis.

This feature aims to make it easier for users to work with text content within images, eliminating the need for manual transcription or typing. It can be particularly useful in scenarios such as digitizing printed documents, extracting text from screenshots, or working with images containing textual information.

Please note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on the application's codebase and the technologies used. This summary provides a high-level overview of the "Read Image" feature's functionality and benefits.
