# Productboard

![screenshot](./metadata/productboard-1.png)

## Setup

Currently, this extension can:

- view existing notes
- add new notes

You'll also need a Public API Access token. To create access token, go to Integrations. Scroll down to _Public API_ section and create a new one to use with Raycast. You will need to have admin rights to be able to do it.

Then, paste access token into the Raycast preferences for this extension.

Note: You need to create _Access token_. Do not confuse it with _GDPR Public API_ key.

## Additional preferences

Adding metadata to your note can make the note triaging in the Productboard easier. You can set default presets for them.

- Default tags – adds a default set of tags in add note dialog. Can be overriden.
- Default Said by – adds a default email to _Said by_ field in add note dialog. Can be overriden.
