# Progress

## What Works
- Core conversion functionality for Markdown to Tana format
- Three main command workflows:
  - Quick clipboard conversion (no UI)
  - Paste and edit interface
  - Convert selected text
- All basic Markdown elements:
  - Headings (H1-H6)
  - Bullet lists (`-`, `*`, `+`)
  - Numbered lists
  - Paragraphs
  - Nested content
- Field detection and conversion
- Python script alternative for large files
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Specialized format support:
  - YouTube transcript timestamps
  - Limitless Pendant transcriptions
- Proper indentation hierarchy for nested content under headings

## Recent Additions
- Version 1.3.0 (2025-04-03):
  - Added support for Limitless Pendant transcription format (#8)
  - Improved hierarchical indentation for transcriptions
- Version 1.4.0 (2025-04-05):
  - Fixed indentation hierarchy for bullet points under H3+ headings (PR #11)
  - Improved handling of Limitless Pendant transcription indentation
  - Made tests more robust by checking content instead of exact spacing
- Version 1.4.1 (2025-04-06):
  - Cleaned up test directory structure (Issue #12)
  - Removed duplicate test files
  - Consolidated testing approach to use Jest
  - Updated jest.config.mjs to explicitly target tests in src directory
  - Added testing documentation to README.md
  - Organized example files into more structured directories
  - Removed obsolete files (claude-issue.md and duplicate examples)
  - Enhanced Prettier configuration to format Markdown files (Issue #13)
  - Implemented consistent code style with single quotes and no semicolons
  - Added trailing newlines to all files for POSIX compliance
  - Fixed formatting issues flagged by Raycast's Greptile bot

## What's Left to Build
- Features in development:
  - Support for more complex Markdown structures
  - Additional formatting options
  - Performance optimizations
- Potential future enhancements:
  - Support for tables
  - Enhanced code block handling
  - Additional special format conversions
  - Support for more transcription formats

## Current Status
- Version 1.3.0 released (stable)
- Pull request submitted to Raycast store (PR #18361)
- Core functionality complete and tested
- Python script implementation stable
- Documentation complete

## Known Issues
- Potential edge cases with complex nested structures
- Special formatting that may not convert correctly
- Performance considerations with very large documents
- Need for continued refinement of conversion rules

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests in place for core conversion logic
- Manual testing conducted for complex scenarios
- Jest testing framework implemented
- Additional test cases being developed for edge cases
- Comprehensive tests for transcription format detection and conversion

## Implementation Process
- GitHub issue creation with clear requirements (#8)
- Feature branch development (issue-8-limitless-pendant-support)
- Parallel implementation in TypeScript and Python codebases
- Test-driven development approach
- Documentation updates (README and CHANGELOG)
- Pull request and code review
- Version bump and release
- Raycast store submission
