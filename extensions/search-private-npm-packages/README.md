# Private npm Packages Search

This is a simple tool to search for private npm packages in a given directory. It will search for the packages under a user or organization account. For example, if you have a private npm package under the `@raycast` organization, you can search for it using this tool.

# Usage

You'll have to add the account to track as well as provide the access token to the account. The access token is required to fetch the list of packages under the account. You can generate a new read-only access token by following this [instruction](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens).
