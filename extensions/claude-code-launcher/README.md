## Common Questions

**Where do I get Claude Code?**  
Visit [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) to download and install Claude Code.

**Can I use a different terminal?**  
Currently supports Terminal.app and Alacritty. PRs are welcome for additional terminal support.

**Projects not showing up?**  
Make sure you've added them first with `⌘N`. The extension only shows directories you've explicitly saved as favorites.

Check that `claude` is in your PATH. Run `which claude` in terminal to verify.
