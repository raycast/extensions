The running time entry is always visible on the top of the window with its duration, description, and project. It is easily stopped by clicking on it or using the enter command.

The extension lists out recent time entries and allows you to resume them.

### Multiple workspaces and clients

The extension supports multiple workspaces and clients out of the box, and will group projects by both. This resembles how projects are grouped when selecting them on the official web app (https://track.toggl.com).

### Cached resources

The extension caches projects, workspaces, tags and recent projects from Toggl Track, to spare internet bandwidth and unnecessary loading!

## Planned features

* Edit the ongoing time entry
* Weekly report
