# OpenStreetMaps Search

## Setup

1. Enter your home address in Raycast preferences. It will be used to quickly pull up directions to your home.
2. Select your preferred mode of travel. This will be the default for all searches.
3. As [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) does not have automatic injection of current location based on URL input, automatically using your current location is not possible.

## Searching

Use the extension's search fields as you would use the ones on OpenStreetMaps.

## Privacy

This extension only stores your address locally to pass it to the OpenStreetMaps API. This extension does nothing else with your info.
