# Microsoft Edge Extension

- Open new tabs in Microsoft Edge
- Search and jump to currently open tabs in Microsoft Edge Browser
- Search and open Microsoft Edge tabs from search query based on browser history across all profiles.
- Search and open Microsoft Edge tabs from search query based on bookmarks across all profiles.
- Directly copy the URL of the Topmost Active tab

*Note*:

Open profile support is limited to opening tab in new profile window. You can customize default tab opening behaviour in settings.

If you are using `Default` mode and have multiple profiles open in parallel, the tab will open in the topmost window.

These are due to limitations in the Microsoft Edge API.
