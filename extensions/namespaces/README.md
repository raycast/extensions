# NameSpaces

Name your macOS Spaces

## Notes

This is **not** a full-blown system-level-integrated solution for managing Spaces in macOS. It simply provides a way to include *existing* Spaces into your Raycast workflows by giving them a user-friendly name and a color. Making switching between them a little more fun.

## Usage/Configuration Tip

Use the [Key Codes](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/key-codes/id414568915?mt=12) App from the App Store to easily grab the correct keyCode for your keyboard's keys.
