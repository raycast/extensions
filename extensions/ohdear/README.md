# Oh Dear

[Oh Dear](https://ohdear.app) is the all-in-one monitoring tool for your entire website.

It monitors uptime, SSL certificates, broken links, scheduled tasks, application health, DNS, domain expiry and more.

We send notifications when something's wrong. All that paired with a developer friendly API and kick-ass documentation.
