# Schoology Changelog

## [View Individual Assignments Grades] - 2024-1-02
- You can now see individual assignments, comments, grades, and even when they were graded!
- You can also see when the grade for a course was last updated for increased convenience.

## [The extension now *actually works*] - 2024-1-01
- Thanks to someone's help (@Armster15), I was able to fix some issues with requesting data from Schoology API.
- Your courses will not be named random letters and numbers (the course_id) and will have the actually name of your course (course_id)
- Your grades will also be accurate

## [Updates to UI] - 2023-8-24
- Now, the percentage isn't a tag, but just a text accessory
    - It's more aesthetically pleasing since the spacing is consistant
- Now, as well as pasting a grade for a class, you can also just simply copy it!

## [Initial Version] - 2023-08-11
