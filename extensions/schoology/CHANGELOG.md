# Schoology Changelog

## [The extension now actually works] - 2024-01-02
- Thanks to someone's help (@Armster15), I was able to fix some issues with requesting data from Schoology API.
- Your courses will not be named random letters and numbers (the course_id) and will have the actual name of your course (course_id)
- Your grades will also be accurate

## [Updates to UI] - 2023-8-24
- Now, the percentage isn't a tag, but just a text accessory
    - It's more aesthetically pleasing since the spacing is consistent
- Now, as well as pasting a grade for a class, you can also just simply copy it!

## [Initial Version] - 2023-08-11
