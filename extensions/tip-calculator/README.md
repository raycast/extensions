# Tip Calculator

Inspired by the Google Tip Calculator, I have now created a faster way to calculate your tip per person and your total. Calculate the total per person based on the bill, tip percentage, and number of people!

## Preferences
On opening the extension, you will be asked to enter a keyboard character that represents your currency. Here are a few examples of a valid currency: $, €, £, ¥, ₹, Fr, R, د.إ, R$, ₽

You will also be prompted to choose whether you can APPEND (add to end) or PREPEND (add to beginning) the symbol you have chosen.

If you want to change your selection, you can always head back to settings to change it!
