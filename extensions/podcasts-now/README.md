# Manage Podcasts

When using Podcasts Now for the first time, it will ask to manage podcasts, meaning the user must fill in podcast feed URLs manually or import them from a file.
Then the user could add or remove podcasts at any time through the "manage podcasts" action in the actions panel.

# Play a Podcast

The user can explore all subscribed podcasts. Enter any podcast, and it will show all episodes from that podcast.
Select an episode will start playing the episode through Music.app (will run Music.app in the background).

# Pause/Resume

There is a player section on top of the podcasts list section. It will show the current player's state, like playing/pause/stopped.
Tapping the item will toggle play/pause for the current playing podcast.

# Forward/Rewind

This plugin allows users to forward/rewind 15 seconds through actions listed in the action panel.
