<br/>

Get real-time public transport information from all of Norway straight in your command bar. Search for any stop place or public transport hub near you, view upcoming departures, or get trip suggestions to and from anywhere in Norway. If you save your frequently used stops and lines as favorites for quick access, there will be no faster way to check when you need to get up and go.

Data made available by Entur, using the [Journey Planner API](https://developer.entur.org/pages-journeyplanner-journeyplanner).

## Features

### Departures

Search for any bus, train, ferry or even Hurtigrute-stop in Norway, and get real-time updates on upcoming departures. Save favorites for quick access using ⌘⇧P. Filter by line, mode of transport or authority by typing in the search field.

### Search Trips

Pick a starting point and destination, and get a list of route suggestions, whether that's home from work, or to the other side of the country. This uses the [OpenTripPlanner](https://www.opentripplanner.org/) engine to find the fastest route with any available mode of transport to get you from A to B.
