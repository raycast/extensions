## Setup

You'll need a Personal Access Token to use this extension. To create this, login to your zeplin account in browser and go to https://app.zeplin.io/profile/developer and click "Create new token" on the "Personal access tokens" section. You can give a name like "Raycast Extension", you don't need to give it "admin access" since this extension does not require it.
