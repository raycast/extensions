# Todos

Things that I didn't get to yet:

- [ ] Error handling, lol
- [ ] Use AbortController to cancel running fetch requests before starting a new one
- [ ] An empty view that gives Giphy some more attribution and love
  - Also need "Powered by GIPHY" attribution to get a production API Key
- [ ] Configurable settings, i.e. for filtering differently rated GIFs
- [ ] Submit the Raycast extension
