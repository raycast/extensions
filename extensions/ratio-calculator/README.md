# Ratio Calculator

A calculator for quickly calculating ratios/proportions. You can use it to both find missing values or check if two ratios are equivalent.

## Syntax
- You can use both `:` and `/` as seperators in the ratios (you can also use them interchangebly)
- You can use either a space or `=` to seperate the two ratios
    - When using `=` to seperate ratios, whitespace will be ignored (meaning you can write `1 / 2 = x / 2 6` without any problems!)
    - When using a space to seperate ratios, other whitespace will **NOT** be ignored (`1/2 2/4` will work, `1/2 2 /4` will not)
- To find the value of a variable, use it in a ratio instead of a number. Variables can be as long as you want, but can **NOT** contains spaces. E.g. `16/9 = width/1234`
- To check if two ratios are equivalent, type them both, seperate them with a space or `=` and then the extension will output whether they are equal!
