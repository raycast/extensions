# React Native Directory

A searchable and filterable directory of React Native libraries for Raycast.

## Usage

1. Launch Raycast and type `react native directory` or `Search React Native Libraries`
   to execute the command.

2. Use fuzzy search to find React Native libraries based on their names, descriptions, or categories.

3. Apply filters to narrow down results:

   - Platforms (Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, tvOS, visionOS)
   - Status (e.g., Supports New Architecture, Has examples, Has TypeScript types)
   - Type (Libraries, Development tools, Templates)

4. View detailed information about each library in the sidebar, including:

   - Description
   - Directory score
   - GitHub stats (stars, forks, watchers, issues)
   - NPM download stats
   - Supported platforms
   - Compatibility info

5. Use the Action Panel to:
   - Open documentation in browser
   - Toggle detail view
   - Copy installation commands (expo, npm, yarn, pnpm, bun)
   - View on GitHub or NPM
   - Copy library name
