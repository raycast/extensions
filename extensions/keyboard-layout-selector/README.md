# Keyboard Layout Selector

Selector keyboard layout without selection.

Inspired by [KeyboardLayoutSwitcher](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/keyboard-layout-switcher) by [Agus Luques](https://github.com/agusluques)
and [Typer
](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/typer/) by [Yaron Schwimmer](https://github.com/yaronschwimmer).

It uses [keyboardSwitcher](https://github.com/Lutzifer/keyboardSwitcher) by [Wolfgang Lutz](https://github.com/Lutzifer) to _list_ and _select_ available layouts and depends on the binary.
