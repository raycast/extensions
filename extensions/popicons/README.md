# Popicons

[Popicons](https://popicons.cc/) is a collection of icons that can be browsed and copied. The collection includes three styles: *Line*, *Solid*, and *Duotone*. The icons are meticulously crafted by [Filip](https://twitter.com/filipistyping) to achieve a perfect balance of aesthetics and practicality. 

The icons are tagged in detail, making it easy to search for specific icons. New icons are added to the collection on a monthly basis. When you open the extension, the new icons are automatically downloaded.
