# Apple Notes

Search for and create Apple Notes directly within Raycast.

## Search notes

There are various ways to search for a note in Apple Notes. You can search a note by its title, folder name, account name, snippet (1st few lines of a note), or accessories. The latter means there are special keywords to search for some notes:

- Use `checklist`, `todo`, and `task` to view your tasks with a checklist. `progress` and `active` show your checklists in progress, while `done` and `completed` display your completed checklists.
-  Use `locked`, `password`, or `protected` to access your password-protected notes.
-  Use `shared` to view notes you have shared with someone.

## Create notes

There are two commands that allows you to create new notes:

- `New Note` is the manual way of creating a note. You can do it through various ways: selecting a text, filling the `Text` argument, or using `New Note` as a fallback command.
- `AI Note` allows you to use the AI to write a note. There are two arguments to this: `Text` which is essentially the note's topic and `Additional instructions` allowing you to provide instructions to the AI.
