## Installation

3. Use the actions in the Action Panel to:

## Security Note

This extension accesses Chrome cookies to retrieve your Google account information. It:

- Uses the [chrome-cookie-decrypt](https://github.com/lacherogwu/chrome-cookie-decrypt) package to read cookies from Chrome
- Only accesses cookies from Google domains
- Does not send your data to any external servers except Google's own services
- Stores a cache of your accounts and pinned preferences locally

The extension needs these permissions to show you which accounts you're logged into. If you have security concerns, you can review the [source code](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/gmail-accounts) to see exactly how your data is handled.

## Requirements

- macOS
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)
- Google Chrome browser installed at `/Applications/Google Chrome.app`

## How It Works

The extension reads your Chrome cookies to identify Google accounts you're logged into, then displays them in a convenient list within Raycast. You can then quickly access your Gmail inbox for any account with a single click.
