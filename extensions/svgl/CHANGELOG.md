# svgl Changelog

## [Big Update] - 2024-04-13

### Pin SVGs

You can now pin SVGs, and they will display at the top of the list in the `All View`.

Additionally, there are some small additions for the pinned SVGs:

- You can use the `Pinned` filter to see only pinned SVGs.
- You can move pinned SVGs up and down the list.
- You can unpin the SVGs if desired.

### Recently Used SVGs

When you copy an SVG's file, React component, etc., it will be added to the `Recently Used` list. You can see the last 12 copied SVGs in the `Recently Used` list, and there is also a filter for this list.

### All View Redesign

The `All View` has been redesigned. It will show pinned SVGs at the top, recently used SVGs second, and all SVGs grouped by their categories in the list below.

### Request SVG

You can use the `Request SVG Logo` command to request SVGs you want to add to the svgl.

### Other Improvements

- The icon count for each category is now shown in the grid section's subtitle.
- Each API call is now cached locally in Raycast, making it faster than before.
- The Grid View now displays the SVGs in a 6-column layout, allowing more icons to be shown simultaneously.
- Remove the category subtitle below the SVG name to make it cleaner.
