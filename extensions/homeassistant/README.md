## Obtaining the Access Token for Home Assistant

- Go to your Home Assistant instance (e.g. `https://myhomeassistant:8123`)
- Click on your profile (next to notifications) in the left sidebar
- Scroll down to the `Long-Lived Access Tokens` section
- Create a token via `Create Token`
- Store the token in a secure location; Home Assistant won't show it again
- Open the Raycast preferences for Home Assistant or start a Home Assistant command
- Set your Home Assistant URL (e.g. `https://myhomeassistant:8123`)
- Set your access token from the previous step into the `API Token` field

Now you should be able to manage your Home Assistant instance with Raycast ðŸš€.

## Home Network Detection

You can optionally define an internal URL for your local home network, which typically offers a faster connection.
The internal URL is used when your home network's Wi-Fi SSID is detected or when the internal URL is pingable (ping can be disabled in cases where it may be slow).
You can define one or multiple home network SSIDs.

### Example

- Home Assistant URL: `https://1234321234331.ui.nabu.casa`
- Internal URL: `http://homeassistant.local:8123`
- Home Wi-Fi SSID: `MyWifi1`, `MyWifi2`

If the current Wi-Fi SSID is `MyWifi1` the internal URL will be used.
If the current Wi-Fi SSID is `AnotherNetwork` the Home Assistant URL will be used.

## Requirements

The minimum required version of Home Assistant is `2024.04`.
