### **Leaderboards**

In theory, there should not be more than one active season. Aimlab will determine the currently active season.
You can filter the displayed seasons based on their active status. There are two options available: 'All Seasons' or 'Only Active Seasons'.

Seasons are divided into multiple tasks, and you can view the leaderboard for each task.

The 'Top Creators' section showcases the leaderboard of the top 10 creators who have the highest number of plays and users on the tasks they have created.
