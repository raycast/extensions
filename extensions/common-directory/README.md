ðŸŒŸ**Important Tips**:

- When you use the **Common Directory** command, You can tell if the path is valid by the icon at the end of the list item.

- When you use the **Add Directory** command, the extension will automatically detect the path to the Finder folder.
  - This command will detect the selected folder first.
  - If there are no selected folders, the folder that gets the focus (activated by the mouse) is detected.
  - You can also fill in the folder directory manually (Mac's native way of choosing folders).


- When you use the **Send File to** command, the extension will automatically detect the file you select.
  - Please keep the Finder in focus (use mouse clicks to activate or otherwise switch the window to ensure it is at the top), and you need to have the files or folders selected.
  - This command supports batch operation, you can select multiple files and folders at a time.
  - You can select the Common Directory and Open Directory as destination path, and you can also select them manually (Mac's native way of choosing folders).
  
- ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ**The principle of handling duplicate file names**ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
  - Due to UI limitations, this extension only provides two options (Cancel and Overwrite All) when it detects renamed files(folders).
  - When you want to send a folder to the directory where its parent folder is located, if the file has the same name as the parent folder, it will be ignored (it will not be moved or copied).
  - The files(folders) cannot be sent to the '/User' directory.

- Sometimes Raycast does not detect the selected files (folders), this is Raycast's bug, you just need to restart Raycast.
