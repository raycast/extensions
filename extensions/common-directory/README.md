ðŸŒŸ**Extra Tips**:

- When you use the **Add Directory** command, the extension will automatically detect the path to the Finder folder.

  - This command will detect the selected folder first.
  - If there are no selected folders, the folder that gets the focus (activated by the mouse) is detected.
  - You can also fill in the folder directory manually (Mac's native way of choosing folders).
