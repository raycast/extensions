# Workspace Selection Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Mandatory Workspace Selection**
- ✅ All commands now require a workspace to be selected before proceeding
- ✅ If no workspace is selected, users see an empty state with action to select one
- ✅ Selected workspace is persisted using Raycast's LocalStorage API

### 2. **Workspace Selector Bug Fixed**
- ✅ Created dedicated `WorkspaceSelector` component that properly loads workspaces
- ✅ Fixed the "no workspaces showing" bug by implementing proper data loading
- ✅ Added error handling and retry mechanisms

### 3. **Workspace Switching**
- ✅ Added "Switch Workspace" action (Cmd+W) to all file operations
- ✅ Created dedicated "Manage Workspaces" command for workspace management
- ✅ Users can easily switch between workspaces without losing context

## New Components Created

### 1. **WorkspaceSelector** (`src/workspace-selector.tsx`)
- Reusable component for workspace selection
- Shows current workspace if one is selected
- Handles workspace switching with proper feedback
- Error handling and loading states

### 2. **ManageWorkspaces** (`src/manage-workspaces.tsx`)
- Dedicated command for workspace management
- Shows currently selected workspace
- Allows switching and clearing workspace selection
- Provides workspace overview with creation dates

## Updated Components

### 1. **BrowseFiles** (`src/browse-files.tsx`)
- Now checks for workspace selection on startup
- Shows workspace selector if none selected
- Added "Switch Workspace" action throughout navigation
- Maintains folder navigation state when switching workspaces

### 2. **SearchFiles** (`src/search-files.tsx`)
- Requires workspace selection before allowing search
- Search is scoped to selected workspace only
- Advanced search form simplified (no multi-workspace option)
- Clear search results when switching workspaces

### 3. **UploadFile** (`src/upload-file.tsx`)
- Fixed workspace selector bug by using new WorkspaceSelector component
- Shows current workspace clearly in upload configuration
- Folder selection only loads after workspace is selected
- Better feedback when switching workspaces

## Enhanced Types (`src/types.ts`)

### New Functions Added
```typescript
// Workspace storage functions using Raycast LocalStorage
export const getSelectedWorkspace = async (): Promise<RazunaWorkspace | null>
export const setSelectedWorkspace = async (workspace: RazunaWorkspace | null): Promise<void>
export const SELECTED_WORKSPACE_KEY = "selected_workspace"
```

## Package.json Updates

### New Command Added
```json
{
  "name": "manage-workspaces",
  "title": "Manage Workspaces",
  "description": "Select and manage your Razuna workspaces",
  "mode": "view"
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. **Clear Workflow**
1. User opens any Razuna command
2. If no workspace selected → automatic workspace selector
3. Once workspace selected → normal command functionality
4. Easy workspace switching via Cmd+W or "Manage Workspaces" command

### 2. **Persistent Selection**
- Workspace selection persists across Raycast sessions
- No need to re-select workspace every time
- Clear indication of currently selected workspace

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Clear error messages when workspace loading fails
- Retry mechanisms for network issues
- Fallback states when no workspaces are available

### 4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- `Cmd+W` - Switch workspace (available in all file operations)
- Standard Raycast navigation patterns maintained

## Command Priority Order

1. **Manage Workspaces** - Primary command for workspace selection
2. **Browse Files** - File and folder navigation
3. **Upload File** - File upload functionality
4. **Search Files** - File search functionality

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Fixes the "no workspaces" bug** - Proper data loading and error handling
2. **Enforces workspace selection** - Can't proceed without selecting workspace
3. **Maintains context** - Workspace selection persists across sessions
4. **Easy switching** - Quick workspace switching without losing navigation state
5. **Better UX** - Clear indicators of current workspace and easy management
6. **Consistent behavior** - All commands follow same workspace selection pattern

The extension now properly enforces workspace selection as a prerequisite for all file operations, fixes the workspace selector bug, and provides intuitive workspace management throughout the user experience.
