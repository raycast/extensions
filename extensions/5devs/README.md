# 5 Devs

> **5Devs is a powerful Raycast extension designed to streamline the development process by providing realistic data for testing purposes.** 

With just a few keystrokes, developers can quickly access a wide range of generated/static information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, documents, and more. 

This extension eliminates the need for manual data entry during testing phases, saving valuable time and ensuring consistent, diverse test data across projects. 

Whether you're building a new application, debugging existing code, or running quality assurance tests, 5Devs provides the data you need to simulate real-world scenarios efficiently.

### How it works

5Devs uses a combination of data sources, including real-world data, to generate realistic test data.

Here is the list of real-world data used by 5Devs:

- Addresses: Real-world addresses (mostly famous places in Brazil), including zip (CEP), street names, city names, and states.
- Vehicles: Real-world vehicles, including make, model, and year.
- Names: Real-world names, including first and last names.

The rest of the data is/was generated using a combination of data sources, including:

- Faker.js: A popular JavaScript library for generating fake data.
- AI: Some data was generated using Claude Sonnet 3.5.
- Others: Other data generator websites.
