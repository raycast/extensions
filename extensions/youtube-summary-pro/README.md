## Features

- **Deep AI Summarization, Not Simplification:** Leverages Raycast AI with carefully crafted prompts (`DETAIL_PROMPT` & `OVERVIEW_PROMPT` - see code) specifically designed to **extract valuable details, examples, and nuances**, rather than just providing a high-level, often unhelpful, overview.
- **Structured for Understanding:** Generates summaries organized into logical sections, making complex information easier to digest and retain.
- **Focus on Actionable Content:** Explicitly extracts practical advice, techniques (the "how-to"), and key takeaways presented in the video, listing them for easy reference.
- **Preserves Key Information:** Aims to capture all significant points, arguments, examples, and even the speaker's perspective, ensuring the summary is a genuinely useful substitute for re-watching.
- **Detailed Timestamped Summaries:** Breaks down the video into sections (`HH:MM:SS - HH:MM:SS`) with corresponding **detailed summaries for each part**, allowing you to dive deep into specific segments or quickly navigate long videos.
- **Handles Long Videos Effectively:** Intelligently splits long transcripts, summarizes each part in detail, and then synthesizes these into a coherent final overview, maintaining depth even for extensive content.

## How to Use

1.  **Copy a YouTube Video URL:** Find the video you want a _detailed_ summary of and copy its URL.
2.  **Open Raycast:** Activate Raycast (usually `‚å• + Space`).
3.  **Paste the URL:** Paste the copied URL directly into the Raycast search bar.
4.  **Select Action:** Choose "Generate New Summary" and press `Enter`.
5.  **Wait for Processing:** The extension will fetch the transcript and generate the detailed summary using AI. Progress is shown via Toasts.
6.  **View In-Depth Summary:** Once complete, the comprehensive summary opens automatically in Raycast's Detail view. Review the overview, actionable points, quotes, and timestamped sections.
7.  **Access History:** Revisit past detailed summaries via the "YouTube Summary Pro" command or by searching your history.
