# Simple Snippet

## About

Originally created because with most AI chat interfaces to submit your prompt you use the "Enter" key... So when you do a new line, if you forget to press "shift" then it submits the chat.

This is waste of compute and also potentially wasteful of your credits (potentially money) too...

This extension was previously called "PromptStore" but is now it is renamed to Simple Snippet, since this is not just useful for storing AI prompts but also to create quick, notes, messages, snippets and so forth.
