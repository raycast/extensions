# obsidian-raycast
This is a raycast extension with commands for the note taking and knowledge management app Obsidian. To use it, simply open Raycast Search, type "Search in Obsidian" to open the command and search for a note.

The command allows for quick access to all of your notes and features several actions which you can trigger with these keyboard shortcuts: 
- `enter` will open the note in "Quick Look"
- `cmd + enter` will open the note in Obsidian
- `shift + cmd + A` will let you add text to the note
- `opt + c` will copy the selected notes content to your clipboard
- `opt + v` will paste the notes content to the app you used before raycast

## Preferences
In the preferences you have to set the path to your vault.
It is also possible to exclude folders, files and paths so they don't show up in the search.

You can specify whether you want the YAML frontmatter and wikilinks removed for copying and viewing the notes content.
