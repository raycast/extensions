# Raycast Utilities

In addition to the [Raycast API](../api-reference/cache.md) which is bundled as part of the app, we also provide a sibling package that contains a set of utilities to streamline common patterns and operations used in extensions.

## Installation

This package can be installed independently using `npm`.

```
npm install --save @raycast/utils
```

`@raycast/utils` has a [peer dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#peerdependencies) on `@raycast/api`. This means that a certain version of `utils` will require a version above a certain version of `api`. `npm` will warn you if that is not the case.
