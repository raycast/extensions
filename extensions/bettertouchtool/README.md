# BetterTouchTool

This extension connects [Raycast](https://raycast.com) with [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) (BTT), allowing you to seamlessly control and interact with BTT's powerful automation features directly from Raycast. Run named triggers, execute actions, and manage BTT variables without leaving your keyboard.

To get started, activate external scripting in the BetterTouchTool preferences. You can also configure a shared secret to prevent unauthorized applications from scripting BTT. Visit the extension preferences to enter the optional shared secret and customize your experience.
