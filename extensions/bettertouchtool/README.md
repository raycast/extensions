# BetterTouchTool

Run BTT actions from Raycast. This extension requires [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) to be installed and the scripting interface to be enabled. (BTT Preferences > Advanced Settings > Scripting BTT > Allow external BetterTouchTool scripting)

## Features

### Run BTT actions

Search for predefined BTT actions and run them. There are over 200 Actions available, although not all of them can be run without additional parameters. Adding input parameters might be enabled in a future version.

### Named triggers

Trigger BTT actions by name. The type of action will be displayed and in some cases you can hover over the action to see a preview of the code/file that will be executed.
