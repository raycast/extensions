This extension lets you control your Bluetooth devices with a few keystrokes.  
Connecting to your Bluetooth devices has never been faster :)

## Getting Started

Visit this extension's [store page](https://www.raycast.com/VladCuciureanu/Toothpick) to get started.  
After installing, follow the instructions on screen, and you should be good to go!

## Setting up favorite devices

1. Go to the extension's settings
2. Enable the desired number of favorite device commands
3. Ensure "Toothpick" (the extension) is highlighted (and not a command)
4. Write your device's name in the corresponding preference field.

You should now be able to connect to your device of choice via the configured commands.

## Feedback

A lot of workarounds were used to implement many of the core functionalities.  
Not to mention that this extension was also a whim project. So, I would be  
happy to hear what you think of it and how it could be improved upon.
