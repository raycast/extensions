## How to setup the Location of the python bin

In order for Raycast to find bibmanager, you need to provide the location of the python binary that is used to execute bibmanager. 

1. Open the terminal
2. Check that you are able to use bibmanager: `bibm -v`
3. run `which bibm` 
4. Select the path and copy it
5. Paste the path into the preference field for the python bin
