# MUI Documentation Search

Search the online [MUI](https://mui.com/) documentation within [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/).

## Features

- Actions to open the web documentation page and a component's source code on GitHub.
- Contextualize your search based on a selection of MUI libraries. Excluding libraries that you are not interested in will improve the relevance of your search results.
- Set a maximum limit for search results per section (_Components_, _Components API_, etc.) to get more distinct search results.
