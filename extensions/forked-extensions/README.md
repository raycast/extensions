# Forked Extensions

The extension for helping you manage your forked Raycast extensions.

## Principles

This extension used the [Git sparse-checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout) feature to manage your forked extensions.

_Please note that the `fork` we mention here is not the same as Git's `fork`._

## Features

- [x] Explorer full extension list
- [x] Sparse-checkout an extension
- [x] Remove an extension from forked list

## Hint

You can always open your forked extension folder in the terminal to work with CLI commands directly.
