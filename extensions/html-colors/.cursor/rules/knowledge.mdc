Explains the domain of HTML colors

- Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors
- Important part: HTML color names
    - use the table in the web page as data source
- Extension can work with both basic and extended colors
    - Basic colors are a subset of HTML colors that are considered fundamental (16 colors)
    - Extended colors include all HTML colors (148 colors), including the basic ones
    - Having basic colors defined separately from extended colors is intentional, as it allows:
        - Easy filtering/access to just the basic colors
        - Maintaining the semantic distinction between basic and extended colors
        - Following the HTML color standard which recognizes these two categories
    - wikipedia article contains table, this table specifies various shades where specific colors belong, e.g. "Pink colors", "Red colors" etc
