# Purpose of the extension

- this extension helps users quickly look up HTML colors by name
- you don't need to remember the exact name of the color, search can be fuzzy with some amount of typos

## UI

- the main interface is search and list of results
- user searches by typing into the search area
- most functionality can be utilized with `<List>` component from Raycast API
- the results are list of possible matches of the colors
- results are ordered by relevance of how it matches the user input
- each result contains the name of the color per standard as individual list item
- there should be a small rectangle displaying the color next to the name
- there should be secondary text showing HEX value of the color
- there should be some icon on each result identifying whether the color belongs to basic or extended set
- UI should contain select which filters the results
    - all (default) shows both basic and extended colors
    - basic color only
    - extended color only
- there should be "actions" panel which can be invoked. this actions panel will offer several actions for the user:
    - copy hex code of the color to clipboard (default)
    - copy rgba color to clipboard
    - copy the name to the clipboard
    - toggle between rgba or hex format in secondary text on search result
