# Create webloc file

This is an incredibly simple extension with one command only: Takes a URL, creates a .webloc file, and allows you to save it to a specified directory.

Webloc files are URL shortcut files for Mac. Double-clicking them simply opens the URL in your browser.

It will only work if you paste a complete and valid URL into the arguments: https://example.com
