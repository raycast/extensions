This is a simple extension that allows you to read [VC.ru](https://vc.ru) news. It works directly in Raycast, no external applications or dependencies are required 

## Commands

- [x] Added "Popular" section

### Not Yet Implemented

- [ ] Adding other sections 
- [ ] Ability to read "my feed"

Maybe someone at vc.ru can tell me where to find a complete list of RSS feeds by category. I was only able to find the "Popular" section

Thanks to Maxim Shishkin for the [post](https://vc.ru/ask/90147-rss-vseh-postov-vc) about RSS feeds
