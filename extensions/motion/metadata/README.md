# Screenshots for Motion Extension

Add screenshots of your extension in action here. You'll need at least one screenshot for each view command:

1. `add-task.tsx` - Screenshot of the Add Task form
2. `list-tasks.tsx` - Screenshot showing a list of tasks 
3. `edit-task.tsx` - Screenshot of the Edit Task form
4. `delete-task.tsx` - Screenshot of the Delete Task view
5. `debug-workspaces.tsx` - Screenshot of the Workspace Details view

## Requirements

- Screenshots should be in PNG format
- Name your screenshots descriptively (e.g., `add-task-screenshot.png`)
- Make sure each screenshot shows your extension working with real data
- Try to showcase the main functionality of each command

These screenshots will be displayed in the Raycast Store to help users understand your extension.
