# Static Marks - Bookmark Search

This extension is made to search through your [Static Marks](https://github.com/darekkay/static-marks) bookmark YAML file.

## How to use

You'll have to provide the location of your [bookmarks YAML file](https://github.com/darekkay/static-marks#file-format), if you don't have one you can create it from your existing browser bookmarks with the [Static Marks CLI](https://github.com/darekkay/static-marks#quickstart).

The extension takes either an **absolute path** (for example `/Users/[user folder]/bookmarks.yml`) or a **public url** (like `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darekkay/static-marks/master/test/examples/maximal-example.yml`).
