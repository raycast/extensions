# Google Maps Search

## Setup

1. You'll need a Google Places API key to use the full functionality of this extension. To obtain one:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Navigate to APIs & Services > [Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library)
   - Enable the [**Places API**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/places-backend.googleapis.com), [**Maps JavaScript API**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/maps-backend.googleapis.com), [**Maps Static API**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/static-maps-backend.googleapis.com), [**Geocoding API**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/geocoding-backend.googleapis.com)
   - Navigate to APIs & Services > [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   - Create an API key under APIs & Services > Credentials
   - Enter this API key in the Raycast extension preferences
2. Enter your home address in the Raycast preferences. It will be used to quickly pull up directions to your home.
3. Select your preferred mode of travel. This will be the default for all searches.
4. For full functionality, you should allow [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) to access your location in your preferred browser. This way, `Get Me Home` and `Get Me Somewhere` will immediately pull up directions starting from your current location.

## Searching

### Get Place Details

Get detailed information about a specific place, including address, phone number, website, opening hours, and reviews.

**Example prompts:**

### Search Nearby Places
