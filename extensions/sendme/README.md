### ‚ö°Ô∏è Lightning Fast

Direct peer connections mean maximum transfer speeds limited only by your network.

### üíª Seamless Raycast Integration

Access powerful file sharing right from your productivity command center 

## How It Works

1. **Share Files**: Select any file or folder to share
2. **Get a Ticket**: A unique ticket is generated and copied to your clipboard
3. **Send the Ticket**: Share the ticket with the recipient via any messaging app
4. **Recipient Downloads**: They paste the ticket and receive the file directly from your machine

## Features

- **Share Files & Folders**: Share single files or entire directories
- **Active Session Management**: View and manage all your ongoing sharing sessions
- **Terminal Fallback**: For complex scenarios, option to run in Terminal
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor downloads in real-time
- **Simple Recovery**: Automatically recovers sessions after restarts

## No Servers, No Limits

Unlike traditional file sharing services:
- P2P
- No accounts or logins required
- No third-party servers involved


### Troubleshooting
The extension looks for homebrew to install sendme. If homebrew isn't found, it tries to install in another way. But if you get an error saying sendme isn't installed, please run these commands:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://iroh.computer/sendme.sh -o ~/sendme
chmod +x ~/sendme
```

Now try Raycast again.

## Privacy & Security

Because Sendme uses direct P2P connections powered by Iroh's technology:

- Your files never pass through any servers
- All connections are encrypted end-to-end
- No data is stored in the cloud
- No metadata about your transfers is collected
