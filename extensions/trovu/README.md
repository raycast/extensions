# Trovu

This extension allows using [trovu.net](https://trovu.net) from Raycast, including the instant suggestions.

Trovu allows you to search 1000+ websites in a command-line way, with

- [curated](https://trovu.net/docs/editors/) and [personal shortcuts](https://trovu.net/docs/users/advanced/),
- organized by [namespaces](https://trovu.net/docs/shortcuts/namespaces/),
- allowing [multiple and typed arguments](https://trovu.net/docs/shortcuts/url/),
- with [maximum privacy](https://trovu.net/docs/privacy/).

It's like [DuckDuckGo bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs), but on steroids. And it's [free](https://github.com/trovu/trovu/blob/master/LICENSE).

There is also a [video summarizing Trovu in 30 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOUNhCion9M).
