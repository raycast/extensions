### Installation Methods

#### üç∫ **Method 1: Homebrew (Recommended)**

Homebrew is the most popular package manager for macOS and the easiest way to install FFmpeg.

**First, install Homebrew (if not already installed):**
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**Then install FFmpeg:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

**For Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3):**
- FFmpeg will be installed to `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg`
- This is automatically detected by AG AudioFlow

**For Intel Macs:**
- FFmpeg will be installed to `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`
- This is automatically detected by AG AudioFlow

---

#### üö¢ **Method 2: MacPorts**

If you prefer MacPorts over Homebrew:

**Install MacPorts** (if not already installed):
1. Download the installer from [macports.org](https://www.macports.org/install.php)
2. Run the installer package

**Install FFmpeg:**
```bash
sudo port install ffmpeg
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

---

#### üì¶ **Method 3: Manual Installation**

For advanced users who prefer manual installation:

1. **Download FFmpeg:**
   - Visit [ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
   - Click "macOS" section
   - Download the latest stable build

2. **Extract and Install:**
   ```bash
   # Extract the downloaded archive
   tar -xzf ffmpeg-*.tar.gz
   
   # Move to applications folder
   sudo mv ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/
   
   # Make executable
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
   ```

3. **Add to PATH** (if needed):
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

---

#### üê≥ **Method 4: Conda/Miniconda**

If you use Conda for package management:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```

---

### Verification & Troubleshooting

#### ‚úÖ **Verify Your Installation**

After installation, verify FFmpeg is working:

```bash
# Check version (should show FFmpeg details)
ffmpeg -version

# Check if AG AudioFlow can find it
# Run "Setup FFmpeg" command in Raycast
```

#### üîç **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

**Issue: "Command not found: ffmpeg"**
- Solution: FFmpeg is not in your PATH. Try restarting Terminal or add FFmpeg to PATH manually

**Issue: "Permission denied"**
- Solution: Run installation commands with `sudo` where indicated

**Issue: "AG AudioFlow says FFmpeg not installed"**
- Solution 1: Restart Terminal and try again
- Solution 2: Run the "Setup FFmpeg" command in AG AudioFlow for diagnosis
- Solution 3: Try manual PATH configuration

**Issue: "Homebrew not found"**
- Solution: Install Homebrew first using the command in Method 1

**For Apple Silicon Mac Users:**
- Ensure you're using the ARM64 version of Homebrew
- FFmpeg should install to `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg`

**For Intel Mac Users:**
- Use the standard Homebrew installation
- FFmpeg should install to `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`

#### üÜò **Still Having Issues?**

1. Run the **"Setup FFmpeg"** command in AG AudioFlow for automated diagnosis
