The fastest way to dash off a quick email to yourself and others. Inspired by [Andrew Wilkinson's tweet](https://twitter.com/awilkinson/status/1748429141601579328).

**Please note:** This extension only supports Gmail accounts.

## Commands

- **Compose Email:** This command gives you more control over the recipients, subject and body of the email. By default, it will pre-select the default recipients in the Extensions Preferences and use the default subject line.
- **Just Send:** This command will use your text selection as the body of the email and send it to the default recipients in the Extensions Preferences, using the default subject line.
