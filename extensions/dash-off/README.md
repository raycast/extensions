- **Compose Email:** This command gives you more control over the recepients, subject and body of the email. By default, it will pre-select the default receipients in the Extesions Preferences and use the default subject line.
- **Just Send:** This command will use your text selection as the body of the email and send it to the default receipients in the Extesions Preferences, using the default subject line.
