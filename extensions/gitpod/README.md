5. Setup your default organization for **Creating** new workspaces in the Manage Workspaces Window.

# Key Features
## Navigating Contexts
With the `Open Context from Github` Command, it's incredibly easy to navigate contexts such as `Repositories`, `Branches`, `Pull Requests` and `Issues`.

### Browsing and Filtering 
- You can browse Repositories and also any context URL inside of the repository i.e. it's branches, PR or Issues
![Browsing Contexts](/assets/Screenshots/NavigatingContexts/Browse%20Repository.png)
![Browsing Ctx](/assets/Screenshots/NavigatingContexts/Inside%20Repository.png)
- Along with that we make sure that your browsing experience should be super smooth with the help of filtering 
You can filter and search further using the following tags
      - `/b` for branch
      - `/p` for PRs 
      - `/i` for Issues
      - `/me` for anything and everything related to 
         - eg. `/me /p` would refer to your Pull Requests in a particular repository!

### Displaying Contexts
Say you're a product manager or an OSS maintainer, you're tired of opening GitHub again and again browsing through issues/prs to find the right one to solve/review, we got you covered by providing context previews, so that you can have a glimpse on Issues/PRs on the fly.

### Pinning Contexts for Faster Access
We pin every context that you open with Gitpod, for faster access and if you wish to manually add any context to your Recents/Pinned list, you can achieve by a single command `cmd` + `R` and bingo!

### Opening Contexts with Github
If Context Display is not enough and you need a deep dive in conversation or add any labels, you can open contexts directly in Github with a single command `cmd` + `RETURN`

## Managing Workspaces
### Starting Workspaces (Requires Gitpod Access Token)
Using the `Managing Workspace` Command, you can *Start* and *launch* your workspaces in your preferrred IDE.
The extension shows you all the stages of your workspaces, Running, Progressing and Stopped.

https://github.com/gitpod-samples/Gitpod-Raycast-Extension/assets/72302948/5cafa2ed-9276-4a3a-9325-bbe4962eae96

Wait!! There is more, with `Menubar Workspace` Menubar command, to do this which is the key feature for `Gitpod Accessibility faster than local.`

### Stopping Workspaces (Requires Gitpod Access Token)
You can use a simple command `Cmd + s`, on the running workspaces and you can see them stopping in real time, just like magic âœ¨

### Selecting Default Editor to Open
You can also select your favourite editor for opening your workspaces, just go to Command Preferences of the Raycast extension with `cmd + ,` and change the default editor, currently the extension supports `VSCode Browser`, `VSCode Desktop` and `SSH` (in your default ssh client with which you can even use VIM, checkout [axonasif/dotsh](https://github.com/axonasif/dotsh).

## Creating New Workspaces
Currently the extension supports two types of creating workspaces, 
1. Creating Workspaces from Context
2. Creating Empty Workspaces 

### Creating Workspaces from Context 
( Requires Gitpod Access token)
You can browse through contexts in the `Open Context from Github` Command and can create a workspace directly from the there just by using `cmd + g`, g for Gitpod.

https://github.com/gitpod-samples/Gitpod-Raycast-Extension/assets/72302948/51dd9170-2f6c-46f1-bca5-7531eaf8f872


Along with that for creating workspaces, you can also add your configuration such as workspace size, just by using `cmd + e`, where you can select your editor and workspace size for a particular context from which a workspace is to be created.

![Configure Tab](/assets/Screenshots/Workspaces/configureWorkspaceTab.png)

### Creating Empty Workspaces 
For creating empty workspaces on the go, say for some quick experimentation, you can use both the `Open Context Command` or `Menubar` Command
