# Restart Running Apps

**What it does**
Lets you quickly restart any app on your Mac right from Raycast. It quits the app if itâ€™s running and then opens it again, saving you the hassle of doing it manually.

This extension is designed for quick restarts, focusing on:

-   Restarting apps instantly from a list of only the apps that are running right now.
-   Restarting safely in the background using `launch` so Raycast stays open.
-   Providing a simple, one-click user experience with a notification when it's done.

It's not meant to be an all-purpose tool for quitting apps. It's made for quickly restarting multiple apps at once.

**Why**
Sometimes apps freeze or need a restart. This makes that process fast and easy without leaving Raycast.

**How to use it**
Just run the command, pick the app you want to restart, and it does the rest.
