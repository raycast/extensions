## Configuring a Personal Access Token

You can use a personal access token instead of logging in through OAuth to authenticate your GitHub account:

The following link can be used as a shortcut to create your token:
https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Raycast&scopes=repo,read:org,read:user,project,notifications

Otherwise, you can manually create it:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" then "Generate new token (classic)
3. Add a "Note" for the token.
4. Select the required scopes:

- `repo`
- `read:org`
- `read:user`
- `project`
- `notifications`

5. Click "Generate token".
6. Copy the token in the "GitHub Token" field in the extension's preferences.

## FAQ

### Can I use my GitHub pull request or issue template?

Yes! Templates for pull requests and issues are supported as long as they are in the `.github` directory.

#### Why can't I see my GitHub organization?

Double-check that you have enabled the correct settings for your organizations on the [GitHub Oauth page](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/7235fe8d42157f1f38c0) to ensure that Raycast is able to show you the data from those repos.
