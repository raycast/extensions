# Dash Extension for Raycast

Interface with the Dash application, allowing users to quickly search through documentation sets

## Find in Dash

Use `Find in Dash` command to search everything in Dash

## Create a dedicated alias for a specific Docset

Sometimes we want to use an `alias` or a `Hotkey` to quickly launch the searching in a single docset, like search in the react document, in that case you can follow the steps below to create a quicklink for that docset:

- Select the `Create Docset Quicklink` command, enter the **docset keyword** you want to create for
- Just press `Enter` to create the quicklink
- The link will be autofilled in the opened form, just give it a name and confirm
- Then go to the Raycast Preference, in the `Extension` panel, find the link you just created in the `Quicklinks` group 
- Assign it with an `alias` or a `Hotkey`, and you are done

## Find in Specific Dash Docset

If you don't want to create an alias for every docset but still want to search in a specific docset, use the `Find in Specific Dash Docset` command, just enter the docset keyword and open the command and everything you search for will be within that single docset.
