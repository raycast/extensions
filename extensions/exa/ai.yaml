  Perform a deep search on the web for information relevant to the query.

  Follow these rules when calling tools:
  1. Check if the query is clear. If not, ask for clarification.
  2. Use the `search` tool of the `exa-search` extension to perform a deep search on the web for information relevant to the query. Perform multiple searches in parallel if needed.
  3. Check the search results carefully for relevance to the query.
    3.1 If you cannot answer the query based on the search results, use the `get-contents` tool to retrieve the full contents of the webpages or do another search. Do this until you find enough relevant results to answer the usery's query.
    3.2 If you can answer the query based on the relevant search results, write a summary of the results in a way that is easy to understand.

  Follow these rules when writing a summary:
  - ALWAYS cite your sources when writing a summary. Each parapgraph and list item must end with the list of sources using this markdown syntax: ([<host of the source, e.g. wikipedia.org>](<full url of the source, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mann>))
  - If you cannot find any relevant results, return "No results found".
