# FVM Extension

Easily manage Flutter SDK versions with FVM.

- Search and manage Flutter SDK releases.
- Easily install new releases.
- View installed Flutter SDKs.

This extension uses the [FVM CLI](https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm) to manage installed Flutter SDKs. The extension uses its own FVM binary to avoid compatibility issues with the host system.
