# Nope! 
Say 'no' to people with style!

Accourding to wikipedia:
> No is an English word that has a negative meaning. It is the opposite of the word yes, which is a positive term.

No is used when someone is turning away something. It is also used when opposing an idea. It can also be used in different figures of speech.

In both sentences and talking, the words "No" and the word "Not" can both be used, though the word "No" is mainly used when speaking to other people. In some cases, however, "Not" is not acceptable, and vice versa. These words are not to be confused with the similar sounding words know and knot.

Now, imagine saying the word "No" in a cooler way? This is Nope!
