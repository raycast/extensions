**⚠️⚠️⚠️ API key Guidelines:** The following is from the [Pexels API documentation](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/#guidelines)

> Do not abuse the API. By default, the API is rate-limited to 200 requests per hour and 20,000 requests per month. You may contact us to request a higher limit, but please include examples, or be prepared to give a demo, that clearly shows your use of the API with attribution. If you meet our API terms, you can get unlimited requests for free.
>
> Abuse of the Pexels API, including but not limited to attempting to work around the rate limit, will lead to termination of your API access.
