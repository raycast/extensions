# Dungeons & Dragons

Look up monsters, spells, rules, and mechanics, all while rolling advanced dice, and even generate random encounters for your party in a pinch. This extension utilizes [the DND5api API](https://dnd5api.co/) to pull and present all data related to D&D 5th edition. An API token is not required.

## Commands
-  *Game Mechanics* - Lookup Conditions, Damage Types, and Magic Schools info.
-  *Monster Compendium* - Access details on 300+ monsters, including alignments and stats.
-  *Random Encounter* - Generate party encounters based on levels and location. _Requires Raycast AI_.
-  *Roll Dice* - Flip a coin or roll various dice types and custom rolls.
-  *Rules Lookup* - Access over 30 D&D rules categories.
-  *Spell Lookup* - View details on 300+ D&D spells by level and school of magic.

## Roadmap
[ ] Add ability to filter Monsters by challenge rating, in the same way Spells can be filtered by level. This is a limitation of the [D&D5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/). I would like to look into updating the API to pull this information in so that this application could use it.
[ ] Add ability to "favorite" commonly used selections like Spells and Monsters for quick access.
[ ] Add ability to roll spells and cantrips from the Spell Lookup command.
