# DeepSeeker - DeepSeek Quick Actions

DeepSeek is a powerful yet cheap LLM. This extension provides quick actions to interact with DeepSeek API. It allows you to quickly ask questions, summarize text, and more. It's a great tool for students, researchers, and anyone who needs quick answers.

While [ChatGPT Quick Actions](https://www.raycast.com/alanzchen/chatgpt-quick-actions) is built for ChatGPT, DeepSeeker is built for DeepSeek. For now, it tries to obey `Multiple Simple` phylosophy. In the future, it tries to provide `more flexibility` for individual various needs.

## Setup

1. Get your DeepSeek API key from [DeepSeek API](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys). It's like `sk-37cd5***********************ac74`. Paste it in the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable in Raycast Settings.
2. The `Custom API Endpoint` is optional. Only if you want to use a custom API endpoint such as ChatGPT's API. Leave it empty if you want to use the default DeepSeek API endpoint. A list of possible endpoints:

   - DeepSeek: `https://api.deepseek.com/v1`
   - ChatGPT: `https://api.openai.com/v1`
   - Gemini: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/`

3. Choose `DeepSeek-V3` or `DeepSeek-R1` (new reasoning model) as the global preferred model. You can also customize the preferred model for each command.

Enjoy using DeepSeeker! 🚀

## Bugs / TODOs / Known Issues

- The stream output is blinking when the result is updated. It should be caused by the Raycast react use effect. The API should be called only once.
- Github Models seem to have issues with stream output. DeepSeek and Google Gemini models are working fine.
