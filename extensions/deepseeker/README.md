# DeepSeeker - DeepSeek Quick Actions

DeepSeek LLM is a powerful yet cheap LLM. DeepSeeker is a Raycast extension that allows you to perform one-shot actions with DeepSeek using Raycast.

While [ChatGPT Quick Actions](https://www.raycast.com/alanzchen/chatgpt-quick-actions) is built for ChatGPT, DeepSeeker is built for DeepSeek. For now, it tries to obey `Multiple Simple` phylosophy. In the future, it tries to provide `more flexibility` for individual various needs.

# Setup
1. Get your DeepSeek API key from [DeepSeek API](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys). It's like `sk-37cd5***********************ac74`. Paste it in the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable in Raycast Settings.
2. The `Custom API Endpoint` is optional. Only if you want to use a custom API endpoint such as ChatGPT's API. Leave it empty if you want to use the default DeepSeek API endpoint.
3. Choose `deepseek-chat` as the global preferred model. You can also customize the preferred model for each command.(For now, DeepSeeker only has one model)
